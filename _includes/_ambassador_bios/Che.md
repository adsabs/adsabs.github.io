Yueyi Che is a glaciologist and a second-year PhD student in the Earth and Planetary Science
department at Stanford University. Yueyi received her Bachelor of Arts from the University of
California, Berkeley in Geology with a Climate Science minor. Yueyiâ€™s current research interests
focus on how glaciers melt and lose mass in the past and under current climate change. As an
explorer, she has conducted glacier fieldwork in Yosemite in California, Mt. Hood in Oregon,
Juneau Icefield in Alaska, and most recently around the Antarctica Peninsula. Outside of
research, Yueyi loves to play ukulele and draw sketches.
