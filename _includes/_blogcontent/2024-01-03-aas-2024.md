Join us at the [243rd American Astronomical Society (AAS) Meeting](https://aas.org/meetings/aas243) from 7-11 January 2024 in New Orleans, LA for an insightful exploration of the [NASA Science Explorer (SciX)](https://www.scixplorer.org/) and the implications of its recent launch for the ADS user community.

The NASA Science Explorer (SciX, [scixplorer.org](https://www.scixplorer.org/)) marks a substantial expansion of the longstanding [Astrophysics Data System (ADS)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/about/), the digital library portal that has stood as a cornerstone of astrophysics research for decades. As an indispensable resource, the ADS service has now broadened significantly with the introduction of SciX, incorporating content in Planetary Science, Heliophysics, Earth Science, and eventually Physical and Biological Sciences.

A diverse set of AAS presentations and activities are planned to help connect you with members of the SciX/ADS team, including:
