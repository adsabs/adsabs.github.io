### Introducing the NASA Science Explorer Ambassador Program

The NASA Science Explorer (SciX) team is thrilled to announce the launch of the SciX Ambassador Program! This initiative marks a new chapter in the evolution of the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) into NASA SciX, with a significant leap in promoting interdisciplinary communication and research. To further this mission, we are seeking approximately 12 researchers to become our Lead Ambassadors, representing diverse disciplines across NASA, including Astrophysics, Planetary Science, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Biological & Physical Sciences. Our goal is to drive forward the vision of interdisciplinary engagement and innovation as a cornerstone of NASA SciX.

The SciX Lead Ambassadors will have the crucial task of educating their communities about the benefits of SciX, and they will do so by presenting on the platform at least twice a year in various formats. To learn more about SciX and gain community engagement skills to better educate their communities the ambassadors will participate in a 2.5-day workshop at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian from August 21 to 23, 2024. This workshop will provide a unique opportunity for the ambassadors to connect directly with the NASA SciX team, learn essential community engagement skills, and receive in-depth training on the NASA SciX platform. This experience will equip them with the tools and knowledge needed to effectively promote SciX within their communities.

In addition to these activities, the ambassadors will collaborate with the SciX team to nurture an online community space dedicated to fostering collaboration, resource sharing, and receiving feedback and suggestions from a variety of users. This platform will allow SciX ambassadors to connect with the NASA SciX team and their peers worldwide, facilitating the exchange of ideas and best practices. By growing this online community, the ambassadors will help bring together researchers from various disciplines, enhancing the interdisciplinary spirit of the expansion of the ADS to SciX.

Recognition is also a key component of the program. The Lead Ambassadors will be featured on the SciX website, providing them with visibility and acknowledgment for their efforts. They will also have opportunities to showcase their work and community engagement initiatives on our blogs further highlighting their contributions to the advancement of open science.

To support their activities, the program offers travel support of up to $2500 for workshop attendance and an additional $2500 to attend a conference of their choice. This financial assistance will enable ambassadors to present on their work and NASA SciX, further spreading awareness of the platform's benefits.

The Lead Ambassadors will serve a two-year term, during which they will participate in monthly online meetings with their cohort and the NASA SciX team. The estimated time commitment for these activities is between 2 and 8 hours per month, ensuring that ambassadors can balance their responsibilities with their ongoing research and professional commitments.

The NASA SciX Ambassador Program aims to empower ambassadors to effectively promote the platform, improve it through community feedback, gain visibility and recognition for their work, and build a robust online community that connects researchers from diverse fields. Through their efforts, the ambassadors will play a pivotal role in advancing the mission of interdisciplinary research and open science.

Interested in becoming a NASA SciX Lead Ambassador? Fill out our short application form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeMmhfklhEDl7sc2uP9Tk7hSQrSjHiTBwL42FIeuYB5L4dOBA/viewform). We especially encourage early career researchers (including graduate students) and members of underrepresented groups in STEM to apply. We accept international applications as well. 

Lead ambassadors will be instrumental in sharing the benefits and features of NASA SciX with their communities and expanding our overall NASA SciX Ambassador Program. We are actively developing educational and training material for educators and ambassadors to present NASA SciX to their communities and we will advertise these resources as they become available. Join us in this exciting journey to bridge disciplines, enhance scientific communication, and foster a community of innovation through the NASA SciX Ambassador Program!
