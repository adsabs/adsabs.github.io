## Selected Lead Ambassadors for the 2025 - 2027 Cohort 

In addition to the first group of NASA SciX Ambassadors, we have also selected a second cohort of individuals who will join the program from 2025-2027.  The two cohorts will overlap in 2025, allowing for mentorship and information exchange to occur between the two groups. These selected individuals include, 

- **Anna Cammaro:** Founder & CEO of a space advocacy firm, dedicated to bridging educational gaps in the global space sector. 
- **Brooke Long-Fox:** A scientist specializing in conservation paleobiology, focusing on the intersection of ecology, biology, and geology.
- **Cielo Sharkus:** A doctoral candidate addressing climate change impacts on local and national levels, with a focus on sustainable adaptation strategies.
- **Keith Siew:** A researcher whose work spans the realms of physiology and innovative technology and which benefits from open science. 
- **Murti Nauth:** A doctoral candidate at the forefront of studying interactions between the solar and Martian magnetic fields to constrain exoplanet habitability. 
- **Saswati Das:** An assistant professor in biochemistry with extensive experience in chemical pathology, medical diagnostics, and public health. 

## Overview of Planned Activities
 
Our Lead Ambassadors are gearing up for a dynamic schedule of activities designed to foster collaboration and community growth. Key events include:
 
- A foundational workshop at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian from August 21 - 23, 2024, focused on training to share NASA SciX with their communities, developing our overall Ambassador Program, networking with the NASA SciX team and fellow ambassadors, and producing materials that will aid further community engagement. 
- Monthly community calls to discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for collaboration.
- Engagement in high-visibility events to represent and promote NASA SciX initiatives.

The ambassadors are entrusted with several crucial responsibilities:

- Facilitating a robust network among their cohort and the broader NASA SciX community.
- Engaging with their local and professional communities to promote the values and goals of NASA SciX.
- Contributing to the NASA SciX blog and online forums, sharing their insights and experiences.

## Engagement Opportunities for the Community
 
We encourage all members of our community to engage with our Lead Ambassadors. Visit the ambassador page for detailed biographies and contact information, and join us at upcoming events to interact directly with these leaders.
The selection of these Lead Ambassadors marks a significant step forward in our mission to forge a stronger, more connected NASA SciX community. Their diverse backgrounds and dedicated efforts will undoubtedly lead to a richer, more inclusive environment for our user community.
