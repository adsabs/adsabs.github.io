The **SciX Lead Ambassador Program** was launched to create a network of researchers who champion SciX within their professional communities. This initiative supports interdisciplinary collaboration, promotes SciX as a valuable resource, and gathers feedback to improve the platform. The **2024 SciX Lead Ambassador Workshop**, held in Cambridge, MA at the Harvard & Smithsonian \| Center for Astrophysics, brought together the inaugural cohort of 11 ambassadors for three days of discussions, collaborative projects, and networking.

## Workshop Highlights
Ambassadors participated in **lightning talks**, **disciplinary focus groups**, and **panel discussions** to explore how SciX can best support researchers across NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) disciplines. One of the most significant takeaways was the value of holding this in-person workshop early in the program—allowing ambassadors to build relationships, share experiences, and establish a strong sense of community.
A key component of the workshop was the **blue sky project activity**, where ambassadors brainstormed and developed innovative ways to expand SciX’s impact. This resulted in the formation of three working groups:
- **Content Creation Team** – Led by Harper Wilkins, Sunny Narayanan, and Yueyi Che, this group will create blog posts, social media campaigns, and highlight ambassador activities throughout the year.
- **Community Guidebook Team** – Led by Sunny Narayanan and Gwyneth Hutchinson, this group is developing a guidebook to define best practices for SciX community engagement.
- **Workshop Report Team** – Led by Stephanie Jarmak, Harper Wilkins, and Sunny Narayanan, this team is compiling key workshop discussions, feedback, and outcomes.

## Ambassador Reflections & Feedback
The workshop received highly positive feedback from ambassadors, who emphasized the value of in-person networking and structured activities. Many felt the **panel discussions, blue sky projects, and disciplinary focus groups** were the most beneficial. Some suggested expanding future workshops to allow more time for technical deep dives and collaborative project development.

Ambassadors left the workshop **better equipped to engage their communities**, with personal work plans outlining how they will integrate SciX into their outreach efforts. Their contributions will continue to shape SciX’s development, making it more user-aware and accessible to a broad research community.
Next Steps
Moving forward, SciX will focus on **expanding the ambassador program, developing an online community platform, and increasing interdisciplinary engagement**. The inaugural cohort will help onboard the next group of ambassadors, ensuring continuity and mentorship. Additionally, efforts will be made to create virtual events, strengthen SciX’s presence on social media, and explore new avenues for community collaboration.

We are excited to continue this journey and build an even stronger SciX ambassador network. Stay tuned for updates and ambassador highlights throughout the year!
