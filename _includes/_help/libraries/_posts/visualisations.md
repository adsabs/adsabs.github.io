Like the main search interface, you can make visualisations, look at metrics, and create exports for the bibcodes within your library. 

To do so, simply navigate to your {{ include.site }} Library via the button under **My Account** and then {% if include.ads %}use the sub-menu buttons **Export**, **Metrics**, and **Visualize**. You can also access the same features by using the **View this library in {{ include.site }} Search Results Page**.{% else %}click **View as search results** to access the **Explore** menu, including visualizations and metrics, and the **Bulk Actions** menu to export the library.{% endif %} 

For details on these features, look at the main [help pages]({% if include.ads %}../../help/actions{% else %}../../scixhelp/actions-scix{% endif %}).
