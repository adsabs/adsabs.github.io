You can search for papers associated with an ORCID ID using the syntax *orcid:[orcid id]* .

Please note that any papers you claim with ORCID using the {{ include.site }}
interface can take up to **24 hours** to be indexed within {{ include.site }}. If
your paper claims are still not registered after that time, verify
that you have supplied any necessary [name variations]({% if include.ads %}{{ site.ads_base_url }}{% else %}{{ site.scix_base_url }}{% endif %}/#user/settings/orcid).
