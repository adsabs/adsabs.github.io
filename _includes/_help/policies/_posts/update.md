# Database update policy

The {{ include.site }} is continuously updating its holdings.  We strive to contain links to current literature and data in our subject coverage areas.  Please be aware that corrections and submissions are not automatically updated in the public interface but will be updated during the next scheduled update.  
The current update schedule is:  
- daily for **arXiv** collection
- weekly on the weekends for **astronomy** collection
- weekly mid-week for **physics** collection
{% if include.ads %}{% else %}- weekly on the weekends for **earth science** collection{% endif %}
- **general** records not included in these subjects are ingested as needed, usually monthly 

The schedule may vary from time to time due to holidays or scheduled maintenance.  In addition, the updating of citations can often lag a few days behind corrections and submissions.
