{{ include.site }} provides the ability to export results into various formats.  There are two options:

1. Export All Results
![export-all-results]({% if include.ads %}/help{% else %}/scixhelp{% endif %}/img/export-all-results.gif){:width="800px"}

From the results page, find the **Export** dropdown menu in the top right of the page.  From there, you can select a format.

2. Export Selected Results
![export-selected-results]({% if include.ads %}/help{% else %}/scixhelp{% endif %}/img/export-selected-results.gif){:width="800px"}

From the results page, find the **Export** dropdown menu in the top right of the page.  From there, you will see **selected papers** checked, and you can select a format.

When the tool is opened, you will have the opportunity to review the export result and either download or copy to clipboard.
