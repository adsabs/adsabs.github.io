Users who have access to electronic resources through their library subscriptions can configure their user preferences so that the appropriate links to the fulltext will be provided when viewing a record in the {{ include.site }}. If your library provides online linking services, and if it has provided the relevant information to {{ include.site }}, all you have to do is select the proper entry in your preferences under [Library Link Server]({% if include.ads %}{{ site.ads_base_url }}{% else %}{{ site.scix_base_url }}{% endif %}/user/settings/librarylink).  If you find an entry for your institute, select it and click on the **Apply** button. If not, please contact your electronic resources librarian and request that they email the information about your institute's OpenURL server to us, at <a href="mailto:{% if include.site == 'SciX' %}help@scixplorer.org{% else %}adshelp@cfa.harvard.edu{% endif %}">{% if include.site == 'SciX' %}help@scixplorer.org{% else %}adshelp@cfa.harvard.edu{% endif %}, so that we can include this in our menu selection.

Once you have selected your *Library Link Server*, you can go back and search the {{ include.site }} as usual. Whenever viewing a record for a paper which has full-text content available online from a publisher, you will notice that a new link named "**My institution**" will appear. Following the link will take you to your library's link resolver, which will give you a list of options available to you for obtaining the full-text content. Please note that the availability of a library link in the {{ include.site }} does not necessarily mean that the full-text content will be available to you, as this determination is done by your *Library Link Server*. However, in general the library server will have the most relevant and complete information about a document's availability to you as a patron.
