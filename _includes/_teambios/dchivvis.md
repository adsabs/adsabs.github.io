Daniel earned his B.A. in Philosophy and Psychology from Clark University in 2017, and later pursued his M.S. in Library & Information Science from Simmons University in 2019. In September 2018, he joined the John G. Wolbach Library team at the CfA, conducting research on software citation practices in astronomy. Following this, in July 2019, he secured a fellowship position at the CfA, where he created MetaSatâ€”an open-source metadata vocabulary and ontology for spacecraft. Most recently, in June 2023, Daniel transitioned to the Astrophysics Data System, where he plays an active role as part of the curation team while also spearheading the development of semantic technologies.
