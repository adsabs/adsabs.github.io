Kelly Lockhart is the technical lead at ADS, responsible for all software development and operations for the project. She was previously the back-end lead, and before that, was a back-end software engineer with the project. Kelly has been with the project since 2017, starting immediately after completing her PhD at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai&#8216;i at M&#257;noa. Her dissertation research utilized high spatial resolution observations of the centers of nearby galactic centers, including a study of the [nuclear star cluster in M31](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...854..121L/abstract). As part of her dissertation, she also worked with the Keck/OSIRIS Working Group to improve the [data reduction pipeline](https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/OsirisDRP) for the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph on Keck I.
