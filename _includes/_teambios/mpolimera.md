Post graduation, Mugdha joined the ADS back office development team. She is using the pipeline development skills that she cultivated during her Ph.D. to create and improve data pipelines for ADS. She strives to use her experience and background in the Astronomy world to help build a product that will continue to add outsized value to astronomers all around the world.
