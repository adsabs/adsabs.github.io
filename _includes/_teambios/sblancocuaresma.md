[Sergi](https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/) obtained his PhD in 2014 (Marie Curie ITN) at the Laboratoire dâ€™astrophysique de Bordeaux, France, under the supervision of Caroline Soubiran on the determination of stellar chemical abundances and the validation of the chemical tagging technique. Sergi worked for the ESA Gaia mission at the Geneva Observatory in the Stellar Variability group from 2014 to 2017. Sergi worked for ADS from 2017 to 2023, ultimately serving as the Technical Lead. He left the project in 2023 to begin a PhD program in neuroscience but continues to stay involved in the Machine Learning/Natural Language Processing efforts. In his free time he continues to do research developing [iSpec](https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/iSpec/) (an open framework for spectroscopic analysis of stars), and [Posidonius](https://www.blancocuaresma.com/s/posidonius/) (a N-body code for simulating planetary and/or binary systems).
