Taylor received his PhD in Physics from The George Washington University in 2022. His research at GW focused on the computational modeling of the outflows of stellar explosions such as supernova remnants and GRB afterglows.

Prior to coming to ADS, Taylor was a Chandra X-ray Center Predoctoral Fellow at the Center for Astrophysics. There he worked on modeling the full lifecycle of supernova progenitors from pre-main sequence to the remnant phase, with a focus on determining observables derived from high-resolution X-ray spectra. At ADS, Taylor is a back-office developer where he works on updating and extending pipelines and other related back-end projects.
