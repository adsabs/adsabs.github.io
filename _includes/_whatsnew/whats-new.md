## November 2022
* Announcements:
  + ADS has an opening for the Project Scientist for Astrophysics, who will work to establish and maintain the ADS as a world leading information resource for astrophysics and related disciplines. The employee will devote 30% of their time to do original research in astrophysics. The project also has two developer positions still open. Find out more and apply [here](../../about/careers).
  + The ADS team will be hosting the 2022 [ADS Users Group](../../about/adsug/adsug) meeting November 9 and 10. Do you have a request, suggestion, or general feedback about the ADS project? You're welcome to submit it to the advisory panel by [emailing us](mailto:adshelp@cfa.harvard.edu) with “ADSUG” in the subject line.
  + ADS maintains a database of summary information about the publications we index---the Journals database (JournalsDB). It includes information that the ADS uses for internal content management, but that is also useful for librarians and other content managers to know about how specific titles are classified and what the ADS' holdings are for individual titles and volumes. More information is available on our [API documentation](../../help/api/api-docs.html) and in our [example Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api/blob/master/API_documentation_Python/Journals_API_Python.ipynb).
  + ADS pipelines have been updated to calculate metrics for software records ingested from Zenodo. Metrics for these records can be examined individually or in aggregate with any other records.
