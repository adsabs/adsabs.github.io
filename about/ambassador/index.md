The NASA SciX Ambassadors are community advocates working with the [NASA SciX staff](https://scixplorer.org/scixabout/team/). Together, we are building a better interdisciplinary digital library system. [NASA SciX](https://scixplorer.org/) makes research in astrophysics, planetary science, heliophysics, and earth science more findable and accessible. An Ambassador's responsibilities include: 

- Facilitating a robust network among their cohort and the broader NASA SciX community.

- Engaging with their local and professional communities to promote the values and goals of NASA SciX.

- Contributing to the [NASA SciX blog](https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/) and online forums, sharing their insights and experiences.

The 2024 Lead Ambassadors are getting ready for an exciting lineup of events aimed at promoting collaboration and community development. Key events include:

- A foundational workshop at the [Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/) from August 21 - 23, 2024. The program will train Ambassadors to share NASA SciX with their communities, improve our Ambassador Program, foster connections with the NASA SciX team and other ambassadors, and create materials to facilitate community engagement.

- Monthly community calls to discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for collaboration.

- Engagement in high-visibility events to represent and promote NASA SciX initiatives.
