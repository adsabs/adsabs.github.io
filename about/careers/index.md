## Who we are

The Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is the primary digital library portal for researchers in astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science and heliophysics. The ADS corpus consists of over 16 million documents and is growing at a rate of over ten thousand per week. Every astronomy paper ever published and nearly every physics and geophysics article refereed in the past 20 years is fully indexed by the ADS. Over 50,000 scientists and librarians use the ADS daily, all over the world.

Recently, the ADS team has been selected by NASA to extend its coverage and services into the fields of earth science and NASA funded research in the biological and physical sciences. This will create new opportunities for engagement between the ADS team and the other NASA science divisions, bringing together space and earth scientists in the pursuit of NASA's Science Mission Directorate goals.

The ADS project develops and maintains services to facilitate the discovery and access of the scholarly literature published in the relevant fields of research.  The project embraces the spirit of openness long championed by NASA and the astronomy community in general: all the software we are developing is licensed under an open source license model and access to our data holdings is provided via an open API.

The ADS has built a highly scalable and feature-rich platform using a modern development stack: a custom build of the open-source search engine Solr, a highly responsive UI engineered on top of React, a high performance distributed brokerage system, and cloud-based hosted services with Kubernetes in Amazon Web Services. The primary programming languages are Python, Java, and JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Who we are looking for

We have two openings to join our team of about twelve developers and four curators.
