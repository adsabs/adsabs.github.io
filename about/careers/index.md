## Who we are

The NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is the primary digital library portal for researchers in astronomy and astrophysics; it is also used extensively by the physics and geophysics communities. The ADS corpus consists of over 13 million documents and is growing at a rate of several thousand per week. Every astronomy paper ever published and nearly every physics and geophysics article refereed in the past 20 years is fully indexed by the ADS. Over 50,000 scientists and librarians use the ADS daily. 

The ADS project develops and maintains services to facilitate the discovery and access of the scholarly literature published in the relevant fields of research.  The project embraces the spirit of openness long championed by NASA and the astronomy community in general: all the software we are developing is licensed under an open source license model and access to our data holdings is provided via an open API.

## Who we are looking for 

The ADS project has an opening for a [highly-motivated DevOps engineer](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hr/postings/19-63.html) to join its dynamic team of eight software developers and three curators. The ADS has built a highly scalable and feature-rich platform using a modern development stack: a custom build of the open-source search engine Solr, a highly responsive UI engineered on top of React, a high performance distributed brokerage system, and cloud-based hosted services with Kubernetes in Amazon Web Services. The developer will be part of a small, agile team of talented, like-minded individuals who are solving difficult problems as a group.

We're looking for a system developer experienced in administering key components of software infrastructure, including search engines, relational databases, and cloud-based microservices. The successful candidate will be responsible for managing ADS's cloud-based computing infrastructure and system operations, ensuring the security, stability and scalability of the ADS services and its data; working with team members to ensure software modules are production-ready, including managing their deployment and monitoring; collecting metrics about system operations and service usage to support system monitoring, usage tracking and reporting; and collaborating with other team members and stakeholders in the design and development of new capabilities and the maintenance of existing functionality.

## What we offer

The ADS project is funded by NASA through a cooperative agreement and provides its services to the entire worldwide research community in astronomy and physics. We are hosted by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA), one the largest and most diverse astrophysical institution in the world. Here, scientists carry out a broad program of research in astronomy, astrophysics, and earth and space sciences. By joining our group, you will be actively supporting the discovery and dissemination of scientific results to the worldwide research community!

Some of the perks of the jobs include:

  * Work with a creative, multitalented team in a first-class academic environment
  * Generous benefits, flexible work hours, and (local) telecommuting options
  * Access to the astronomical community and events at the CfA and Harvard University
  * Engage with users at community meetings and present your work at scientific conferences in astronomy and information science
