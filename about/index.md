title: "About ADS"
---

The SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is a digital library portal for researchers in astronomy and physics, operated by the [Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO)](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/sao) under a NASA grant.

The ADS maintains three bibliographic databases containing more than 12.8 million records covering publications in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Physics, and the arXiv e-prints. Abstracts and full-text of major astronomy and physics publications are indexed and searchable through the new ADS "Bumblebee" [modern search form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) as well as the traditional [classic search form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#classic-form). A [browsable paper form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#paper-form) is also available. 

In addition to maintaining its bibliographic corpus, the ADS tracks citations and usage of its records to provide advanced discovery and evaluation capabilities. Integrated in its databases, the ADS provides access and pointers to a wealth of external resources, including electronic articles available from publisher's websites, astronomical object information, data catalogs and data sets hosted by external archives. We currently have links to over 13.3 million records maintained by our collaborators. 

**Please note that all abstracts and articles in the ADS are copyrighted by the publisher, and their use is free for personal use only.** For more information, please read our page detailing the [Terms and Conditions](../help/terms) regulating the use of our resources. 

The importance of ADS's role in supporting the scientific community [has been recognized by societies and individuals](../about/awards.html). If you wish to acknowledge us in a publication, kindly use a phrase such as the following:
*"This research has made use of NASA's Astrophysics Data System."*
