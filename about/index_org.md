The Astrophysics Data System (ADS) is a Digital Library portal for researchers in Astronomy and Physics, operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) under a NASA grant. The ADS maintains three bibliographic databases containing more than 13.5 million records covering publications in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Physics, and the arXiv e-prints. Abstracts and full-text of major astronomy and physics publications are indexed and searchable through the new ADS "Bumblebee" [modern search form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) as well as the traditional [classic search form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#classic-form). A [browsable paper form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#paper-form) is also available. 

In addition to maintaining its bibliographic corpus, the ADS tracks citations and usage of its records to provide advanced discovery and evaluation capabilities. Integrated in its databases, the ADS provides access and pointers to a wealth of external resources, including electronic articles available from publisher's websites, astronomical object information, data catalogs and data sets hosted by external archives. We currently have links to over 13.3 million records maintained by our collaborators. 

**Please note that all abstracts and articles in the ADS are copyrighted by the publisher, and their use is free for personal use only.** For more information, please read our page detailing the [Terms and Conditions](../help/terms) regulating the use of our resources. 

The ADS provides the myADS Update Service, a free custom notification service promoting current awareness of the recent technical literature in astronomy and physics based on each individual subscriber's queries. Every week the myADS Update Service will scan the literature added to the ADS since the last update, and will create custom lists of recent papers for each subscriber, formatted to allow quick reading and access. Subscribers are notified by e-mail in html format. As an option, users can elect to receive updates on preprints published on the arXiv e-print archive via daily emails or by subscribing to a custom RSS feed. 

In 2016 the [ADS Users Group (ADSUG)](../about/adsug/adsug.html) was established to advise the project and to recommend changes and improvements to both its services and procedures in order to maximize the scientific productivity of the community it serves. The ADSUG will advocate for the user community and provide suggestions regarding content curation, technical infrastructure, management, and priority setting. 

The importance of ADS's role in supporting the scientific community has been recognized by societies and individuals. If you wish to acknowledge us in a publication, kindly use a phrase such as the following:
*"This research has made use of the Astrophysics Data System, funded by NASA under Cooperative Agreement 80NSSC21M00561."*
