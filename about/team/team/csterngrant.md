Carolyn has worked at ADS for a very long time.  If you want to see a sketch of the original user interface design, she has one.  Carolyn went to Harvard University, started working at the CfA while an undergraduate, and never looked back. Her current responsibilities at ADS include data ingestion, curation, and content management. Now that her children are grown, she is trying to remember what she likes to do in her free time.
