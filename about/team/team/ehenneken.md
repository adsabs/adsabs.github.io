I received my scientific training in the late 1980s at the Leiden Observatory in The Netherlands. There I wrote my Master's thesis on the then novel numerical method "*Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics*". The main focus in this [study](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1993CoPhC..74..239H/abstract) was to test how well this method could deal with shocks. After that I did [research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1994GPC.....9...69H/abstract) in micro-meteorology on turbulent energy exchange over a melting ice sheet, in particular the Greenland ice sheet. This research, which was part of the *Greenland Ice Margin Experiment* ([GIMEX](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/1993BAMS...74..355O/abstract)), was done in the context of climate change and sea level rise. As part of this research I spent a month retrieving data, about 50 miles up the Greenland ice sheet, near Søndre Strømfjord, Western Greenland. I left academia for a number of years, working in the Internet industry. In 2002 I joined the ADS team. Besides working as IT Specialist, doing software development and managing daily operations of the ADS, I do scientometric research. Michael Kurtz and I have [published](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017arXiv170602153H/abstract) papers on how the scholarly literature is used, about trends in scholarly publishing, the [role](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2012opsa.book..253H/abstract) of the ADS in this context and on how to properly represent all digital products (like [data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015BASIS..41...40H/abstract)) generated by the research life cycle within the ADS Universe. I am also involved in a number of collaborations, like *[Asclepias](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1011088
)* and *[Astrolabe](http://astrolabe.arizona.edu/)* (together with the AAS), and *[PHaEDRA](https://library.cfa.harvard.edu/project-phaedra)* (together with the Wolbach library).
