Kelly Lockhart is a back-end software engineer at ADS, responsible for microservices and data pipelines including the ORCID pipeline and service and the myADS email notification service, and leading development of the ingest parsing library. She also works on user support and translating between developers and astronomers for our blog and other outreach. Kelly has been with the project since 2017, starting immediately after completing her PhD at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai&#8216;i at M&#257;noa. Her dissertation research utilized high spatial resolution observations of the centers of nearby galactic centers, including a study of the [nuclear star cluster in M31](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...854..121L/abstract). As part of her dissertation, she also worked with the Keck/OSIRIS Working Group to improve the [data reduction pipeline](https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/OsirisDRP) for the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph on Keck I.
