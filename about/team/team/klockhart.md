Kelly is an astronomer by training: she completed her PhD in 2017 at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawai&#8216;i at M&#257;noa, focusing on the interaction between galactic centers and their host galaxies using high spatial resolution observations, including a study on the [nuclear star cluster in M31](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017arXiv171001394L/abstract). As part of her dissertation, she also worked with the Keck/OSIRIS Working Group to improve the [data reduction pipeline](https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/OsirisDRP) for the OSIRIS integral field spectrograph on Keck I. After finishing her degree, she moved more firmly into the astronomical software world and started as a developer with ADS the same year.

Her work at ADS includes maintaining and developing the ORCID pipeline and service, supporting users, and translating between developers and astronomers for our blog and other outreach.
