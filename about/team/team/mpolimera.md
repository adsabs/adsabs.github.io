Post graduation, Mugdha joined the NASA ADS back office development team. She is using the pipeline development skills that she cultivated during her Ph.D. to create and improve data pipelines for NASA ADS. She strives to use her experience and background in the Astronomy world to help build a product that will continue to add outsized value to astronomers all around the world. At the CfA, she has also taken on the role of Deputy Chair of the Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging Committee.
