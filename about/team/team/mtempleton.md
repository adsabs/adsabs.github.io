My background is primarily in stellar astrophysics, with a focus on various kinds of intrinsic stellar variability including pulsations.  I spent more than 10 years as staff scientist (and later, Science Director) at the American Association of Variable Star Observers under Arne Henden, and worked as a postdoctoral scientist at Yale University with Sarbani Basu. I did my graduate work at New Mexico State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory, and my undergraduate work at the University of Delaware.

My work at ADS includes curation of our bibliographic data holdings, development of new and improved curation monitors and tools, and creation of features and functionality for the new ADS.
