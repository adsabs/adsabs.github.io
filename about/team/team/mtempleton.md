Matthew's background is primarily in stellar astrophysics, with a focus on various kinds of intrinsic stellar variability including pulsations.  For more than 10 years he was staff scientist (and later, Science Director) at the American Association of Variable Star Observers (not far from the Center for Astrophysics).  Beyond astrophysics, his work there included editorial tasks and management for the *Journal of the AAVSO*, as well as management of the AAVSO's various data archives.  Prior to the AAVSO, he was a postdoctoral scientist at Yale University, and conducted his PhD work at New Mexico State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

His work at ADS includes assisting with the curation of bibliographic and other metadata holdings, development of new and improved curation tools, and creation of features and functionality for the new ADS.
