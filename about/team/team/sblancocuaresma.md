Sergi obtained his PhD in 2014 (Marie Curie ITN) at the Laboratoire d’astrophysique de Bordeaux, France, under the supervision of Caroline Soubiran on the determination of stellar chemical abundances and the validation of the chemical tagging technique. Sergi worked for the Gaia mission at the Geneva Observatory in the Stellar Variability group from 2014 to 2017. Since 2017, Sergi is part of the NASA ADS team as an IT Specialist and, in his free time, he continues to do research and develop iSpec, an open framework for spectroscopic analysis of stars.
