   * **Citation Helper** Clicking on this option gives a list of 10 results which consists of publications that cite and/or are cited by papers in the list you just submitted, but they were not in this list. The process closely resembles the network approach of establishing "friends of friends". Assuming that the bibcodes provided are all valid, it is still possible that no results will be returned. If results are returned, they have a score associated with them. This score essentially reflects how many "friends" know these other "friends".
   * **Metrics**

Currently the following metrics are provided for a list of publications.  If you select records from your search results, the metrics will be displayed for the selected articles.  If you do not select any records a dialog box will appear and you may select all of your results (to a maximum of 3000) or adjust the number of papers to be analyzed by using the slide bar (choosing a number (n) on the slide bar will return the metrics for the first n papers in your current result list.)  

   * Number of papers 
   * [Normalized paper count](metricsdefs#Normalized paper count)
   * Number of citing papers 
   * Total citations 
   * [Normalized citations](metricsdefs#Normalized citations) 
   * Average of citations 
   * Median of citations 
   * [h-index](metricsdefs#h-index) 
   * [g-index](metricsdefs#g-index) 
   * [i10-index](metricsdefs#i10-index) 
   * [e-index](metricsdefs#e-index) 
   * [m-index](metricsdefs#m-index) 
   * [tori-index](metricsdefs#tori-index)
   * [riq-index](metricsdefs#riq-index)

Note that we do not remove self-citations based on author name, because of obvious author disambiguation problems. We apply a list-based removal of self-citations.
