<br>
<p>The ADS Developer API allows you to write scripts that access many ADS capabilites such as the search, metrics, and export functions.</p>

<p>Instructions on how to obtain a key and documentation for the various APIs are on the github repo: <a href="https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api" target="_blank">adsabs-dev-api</a>.</p>

<p>Announcements and discussion related to the Developer API are available via the Google Group, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adsabs-dev-api" target="_blank">adsabs-dev-api</a>. We encourage all API users to subscribe, as the functionality of the API, will likely be improving and changing rapidly.</p>
