Join the ADS team as we unveil the much-anticipated Science Explorer (SciX). We will showcase SciX throughout the meeting; here’s a detailed breakdown of the events we have lined up: Exhibit Hall Schedule: Join us in the Exhibit Hall at the SciX Booth #649 for a personal introduction to the new SciX platform and to pick up your SciX swag in celebration of the launch. You will find us at the Exhibit Hall: Monday: 3pm-6pm Tuesday: 10am-6pm Wednesday: 10am-6pm Thursday: 10am-1pm Science Explorer (SciX) Presentation Highlights: 1. Live Science Explorer (SciX) Demonstrations Kickstart your SciX journey with a live demonstration. Carolyn, Kelly, and Edwin will guide participants through the features of the new SciX digital library portal, providing a quick and easy start to harnessing the power of SciX for scientific literature exploration. Demo #1 with Carolyn Grant When: Monday, 11 December, 5:00pm-6:00pm (PDT) Where: Exhibit Hall Open Science Pavilion Booth #1415 Demo #2 with Kelly Lockhart When: Tuesday, 12 December, 11:00am-12:00pm (PDT) Where: Exhibit Hall NASA Booth #531, Demo Kiosk #2 Demo #3 with Edwin A. Henneken When: Thursday, 14 December, 12:00pm-1:00pm (PDT) Where: Exhibit Hall Open Science Pavilion Booth #1415 2. Discovering and Accessing Planetary &amp; Earth Science Literature with Edwin A. Henneken When: Tuesday, 12 December, 2:10pm - 6:30pm (PDT) Where: Poster Hall A-C - South AGU Program Link Edwin A. Henneken invites you to delve into the heart of SciX. In his poster presentation, he’ll introduce the literature-based, open digital information system that unifies the fields of Astrophysics, Planetary Science, Heliophysics, and Earth Science. Discover how SciX enables the exploration of Planetary and Earth Science literature while championing Open Science principles. 3. Building SciX: An Open Access Digital Library Empowering Earth and Space Science Research with Daniel Chivvis When: Tuesday, 12 December, 2:20pm - 2:30pm (PDT) Where: 014 - West (Level 2, West, MC) AGU Program Link Join Daniel Chivvis for an in-depth look at the content curation method used in developing the SciX Digital Library. Explore how SciX ensures inclusivity by prioritizing Open Access Journals and affiliations with institutions supporting FAIR data principles. Learn how SciX became a hub for accessible scientific research, uniting the scientific community. 4. The Science Explorer (SciX) as a Platform for Open Science with Carolyn Grant When: Wednesday, 13 December, 2:10-6:30pm (PDT) Where: Poster Hall A-C - South AGU Program Link Carolyn Grant takes center stage, presenting SciX as a platform for Open Science. Built on the success of the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), SciX expands its content into Earth sciences. Carolyn unveils how SciX leverages ADS infrastructure to cross-link published literature, preprints, data products, and software packages. 5. NASA Hyperwall SciX Highlight with Alberto Accomazzi When: Thursday, 14 December, 12:15pm (PDT) Where: Exhibit Hall NASA Booth #649, Hyperwall Join Alberto Accomazzi for the grand reveal of the SciX digital library at the NASA Hyperwall. Alberto’s presentation, “Announcing the Launch of the Science Explorer,” marks a monumental moment in the evolution of the Astrophysics Data System into SciX to accelerate the discovery of all NASA Science. Connect with Us: If you’re attending AGU and want an exclusive conversation about SciX, reach out to us at scixcommunity@cfa.harvard.edu. We’re eager to set up one-on-one sessions and discuss how SciX can elevate your scientific exploration. Additionally, as the SciX team continues to grow, we are very interested in speaking with earth science informatics professionals and others who might be interested in playing an active role in the SciX digital library’s ongoing expansion. We will be hiring new staff, convening a SciX advisory group, and launching a community ambassador program. Please come find us in the exhibit hall to learn more about these opportunities to get more involved! We’re very excited to share the Science Explorer launch with you at AGU and look forward to seeing you soon at booth #649!" />

<h3 id="4-the-science-explorer-scix-as-a-platform-for-open-science-with-carolyn-grant">4. The Science Explorer (SciX) as a Platform for Open Science with Carolyn Grant</h3>

<p><strong>When:</strong> Wednesday, 13 December, 2:10-6:30pm (PDT)
<br /><strong>Where:</strong> Poster Hall A-C - South
<br /><a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1398709">AGU Program Link</a></p>

<p>Carolyn Grant takes center stage, presenting SciX as a platform for Open Science. Built on the success of the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), SciX expands its content into Earth sciences. Carolyn unveils how SciX leverages ADS infrastructure to cross-link published literature, preprints, data products, and software packages.</p>

<h3 id="5-nasa-hyperwall-scix-highlight-with-alberto-accomazzi">5. NASA Hyperwall SciX Highlight with Alberto Accomazzi</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> Thursday, 14 December, 12:15pm (PDT)
<br /><strong>Where:</strong> Exhibit Hall NASA Booth #649, Hyperwall</p>

<p>Join Alberto Accomazzi for the grand reveal of the SciX digital library at the NASA Hyperwall. Alberto’s presentation, “Announcing the Launch of the Science Explorer,” marks a monumental moment in the evolution of the Astrophysics Data System into SciX to accelerate the discovery of all NASA Science.</p>

<h2 id="connect-with-us">Connect with Us:</h2>

<p>If you’re attending AGU and want an exclusive conversation about SciX, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:scixcommunity@cfa.harvard.edu">scixcommunity@cfa.harvard.edu</a>. We’re eager to set up one-on-one sessions and discuss how SciX can elevate your scientific exploration.</p>

<p>Additionally, as the SciX team continues to grow, we are very interested in speaking with earth science informatics professionals and others who might be interested in playing an active role in the SciX digital library’s ongoing expansion. We will be hiring new staff, convening a SciX advisory group, and launching a community ambassador program. Please come find us in the exhibit hall to learn more about these opportunities to get more involved!</p>

<p>We’re very excited to share the Science Explorer launch with you at AGU and look forward to seeing you soon at <strong>booth #649!</strong></p>
