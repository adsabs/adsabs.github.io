# The ADS Guide to the 229th AAS Meeting

The ADS team will be staffing booth 711 in the Exhibit area of the Gaylor Convention Center in Grapevine, TX for the duration of the AAS meeting (Jan 3-6, 2017).  

Stop by to learn how to create your own ORCID bibliography using ADS, and how to search the system for individuals using the ORCID system.  Find out how you can find papers talking about a SIMBAD object or filter results by object type.  Have a preview of the data discussed in an article by browsing the plots and images published in it.  And most importantly, grab your ADS swag at our booth and help us improve the system by telling us what you think of it.

## Explore topics discussed at the Meeting

All Abstracts of papers and posters presented at the AAS meeting are indexed in ADS.
Here is how you get the entire list from ADS's Bumblebee interface:
[bibstem:AAS...229](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#search/q=bibstem%3AAAS...229&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc)

We have also created interactive word clouds which capture some of the topics
discussed each day during the meeting for the curious minds:

## Meet the ADS Users Group

The ADS has recently constituted a Users Group which will advise the project
on a wide range of issues.  Community input to the users group is welcome,
and anybody can share their thoughts with any group member.  

More information is available on the
[Users Group web page](../../about/adsug/)
