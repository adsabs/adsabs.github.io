## ADS Unavalable on April 13, 2017

The main ADS site at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), 
[http://adsabs.harvard.edu](http://adsabs.harvard.edu), 
will be shutdown on April 13 at 4pm EDT and will remain unavailable till
approximately 11pm due to scheduled maintenance of the electrical power supply.

During this time, you can still access the ADS Classic interface on one 
of our mirror sites: [http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/mirrors.html](http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/mirrors.html).
The myADS notification service will be unavailable 
for the duration of the downtime.

The ADS Bumblebee interface will remain available, although
some of its link-out and export functionality will be limited.
Please feel free to use one of the available Bumblebee
search forms:

  * [Bublebee modern search form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/)
  * [Bumblebee classic search form](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#classic-form)
