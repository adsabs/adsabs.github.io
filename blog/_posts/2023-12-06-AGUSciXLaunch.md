Edwin A. Henneken invites you to delve into the heart of SciX. In his poster presentation, he'll introduce the literature-based, open digital information system that unifies the fields of Astrophysics, Planetary Science, Heliophysics, and Earth Science. Discover how SciX enables the exploration of Planetary and Earth Science literature while championing Open Science principles.

### 3. Building SciX: An Open Access Digital Library Empowering Earth and Space Science Research with Daniel Chivvis

**When:** Tuesday, 12 December, 2:20pm - 2:30pm (PDT)
 <br>**Where:** 014 - West (Level 2, West, MC)
 <br>[AGU Program Link](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1400075)

Join Daniel Chivvis for an in-depth look at the content curation method used in developing the SciX Digital Library. Explore how SciX ensures inclusivity by prioritizing Open Access Journals and affiliations with institutions supporting FAIR data principles. Learn how SciX became a hub for accessible scientific research, uniting the scientific community.

### 4. The NASA Science Explorer (SciX) as a Platform for Open Science with Carolyn Grant

**When:** Wednesday, 13 December, 2:10-6:30pm (PDT)
 <br>**Where:** Poster Hall A-C - South
 <br>[AGU Program Link](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm23/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/1398709)

Carolyn Grant takes center stage, presenting SciX as a platform for Open Science. Built on the success of the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS), SciX expands its content into Earth sciences. Carolyn unveils how SciX leverages ADS infrastructure to cross-link published literature, preprints, data products, and software packages.

### 5. NASA Hyperwall SciX Highlight with Alberto Accomazzi
**When:** Thursday, 14 December, 12:15pm (PDT)
 <br>**Where:** Exhibit Hall NASA Booth #649, Hyperwall

Join Alberto Accomazzi for the grand reveal of the SciX digital library at the NASA Hyperwall. Alberto's presentation, "Announcing the Launch of the NASA Science Explorer," marks a monumental moment in the evolution of the Astrophysics Data System into SciX to accelerate the discovery of all NASA Science. 

## Connect with Us:

If you're attending AGU and want an exclusive conversation about SciX, reach out to us at [scixcommunity@cfa.harvard.edu](mailto:scixcommunity@cfa.harvard.edu). We're eager to set up one-on-one sessions and discuss how SciX can elevate your scientific exploration.

Additionally, as the NASA SciX team continues to grow, we are very interested in speaking with earth science informatics professionals and others who might be interested in playing an active role in the SciX digital library’s ongoing expansion. We will be hiring new staff, convening a SciX advisory group, and launching a community ambassador program. Please come find us in the exhibit hall to learn more about these opportunities to get more involved! 

We're very excited to share the NASA Science Explorer launch with you at AGU and look forward to seeing you soon at **booth #649!**
