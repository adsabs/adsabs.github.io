Results lists can be sorted in both descending and ascending order. Choose the desired sort order on the search results page using the dropdown menu at the top of the page, below the search box.
<br/>

<h4>Author Count</h4>
This option sorts based on a record's number of authors.

<h4>Bibcode</h4>
This option sorts based on bibcode.

<h4>Citation Count</h4>
This option sorts based on a paper's number of citations.

<h4>Classic Factor</h4>
This option sorts based on a prestige score, designed to more highly rank papers that are relevant and popular now. It is calculated via an age-normalized combination of reads and citation, and is very similar to the ranking applied to results from Classicâ€™s one-box search.

<h4>Date</h4>
This option sorts based on a paper's publication date (month and year).
<br/>

<h4>Entry Date</h4>
This option sorts based on a paper's entry date in the ADS database.
<br/>

<h4>Read Count</h4>
This option is a measure of <b>recent popularity</b>. It sorts on the
90-day read count of a paper: the number of times a paper has been
accessed in the ADS or on arXiv in the last 90 days.

<h4>Score</h4>
This option sorts based on the closeness of the query match. For unfielded searches, commonly searched fields such as author and publication year are more heavily weighted in this sort method.
