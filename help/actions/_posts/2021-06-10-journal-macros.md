## Journal Abbreviations used in the ADS BibTeX entries

Some of the LaTeX-compatible reference formats created by ADS contain macros that need to be properly expanded by TeX or LaTeX in order to produce the correct output. Since the particular formatting depends on the macro package used by the author or publisher and since these formats change with time, we suggest that users always resolve these macros by incorporating the appropriate style file in their documents. The most popular set of macros in use today in astronomy are the ones defined in the [AASTeX](https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/) package and supported by the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. If you use any of the TeX-based formats generated by ADS, you should consider installing and incorporating the AASTeX macros to facilitate the preparation of your manuscript.

However, if for some reason you do not want or are not able to use the AAS macro package, you have the option of incorporating just the macros in your paper as described below. The following macros are taken from the [AASTeX macro package](https://journals.aas.org/aastexguide/#abbreviations) version 6.3.1. You will need to include these macros in your LaTeX source only if you are not using the AASTeX package and need to resolve the macro definitions found in the BibTeX entries returned by ADS. You can copy the needed macros from the table below, or download the .sty file to include in your LaTeX source [here](../actions/aas_macros.sty).
