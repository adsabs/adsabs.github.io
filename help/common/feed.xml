&lt;p&gt;This blog is the final part in the series on data linking and indexing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;Science Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (SciX). In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/data-linking-I&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; part we provided a general overview of the holdings in SciX, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/data-linking-II&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; part discussed the role and merits of linked data in this service. In this part we do something similar for cited data products. There is no fundamental difference between articles citing other articles (something which we have been recording for decades) and articles citing data; actually, the “cites” relationship can be between any bibliographic asset. Citations are just one small subset of the entire graph of linkages between research assets; if we add the constraint that all these research assets must have a persistent identifier (PID), this graph is also referred to as the PID graph. A citation graph is a special case of a PID graph. Figure 1 illustrates the PID graph as generated by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.project-freya.eu/en/front-page&quot;&gt;project FREYA&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666389920302440&quot;&gt;Cousijn et al. 2020&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cited-data-products&quot;&gt;Cited data products&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in part I, citations can only be assigned within SciX when the cited work has a corresponding SciX record as well; in other words it has to be “indexed” in the system. In order to be able to index a record, a minimum amount of metadata of sufficient quality has to be available. Most of the indexed content in SciX consists of literature records, but a significant and fairly recent addition to our collection consists of records representing data and software. &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Asoftware&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt; is truly a &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/asclepias&quot;&gt;recent addition&lt;/a&gt;, but records representing &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Adataset&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;data products&lt;/a&gt; were first introduced quite a while ago. As early as 1995 records were indexed for the data catalogs maintained by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://vizier.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/VizieR&quot;&gt;VizieR database&lt;/a&gt; at CDS. In the early 2000s observing &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Aproposal&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt; were added for a number of NASA missions and observatories. A decade ago we included NASA Astrophysics grant funding proposals. In addition to these sources we are also systematically indexing records for datasets in the Planetary Data System (PDS) and datasets of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SciX is a publication-centric discovery platform, so it supports the discovery of research artifacts as they are linked to the scholarly literature. This informs the strategy for indexing data products: with exception of a certain class of data products, we will only index those that are formally cited in the scholarly literature. While true in principle, this statement needs to be made more explicit and nuanced. For one, we need to specify what we mean by a “certain class”. The nuance is needed for the “formally cited” part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “certain class” criterion relates to the fact that not all data products are created equal. There is a type of data product that is usually referred to as a “high-level science product”, or a “curated dataset”. These data products are almost like publications; in general they go through an extensive reviewing and curation process. It is this class of data products we have in mind for the “certain class” criterion for indexing. The aforementioned PDS datasets are an example of these curated data products. It is not uncommon for high-level science products to be accompanied by data publications: articles in refereed journals describing the data in detail. Often data centers and data authors prefer these articles to be cited, rather than the data product itself. This is typically done by including in a data product landing page a “cite as” statement recommending that a paper citation be used instead. However, reality has shown that these statements are not always followed. It is not clear whether this is the result of an author ignoring this statement or some information being lost during the journal’s copy-editing process. Having said this, the official SciX point of view is that when a data paper is available, both the paper and the dataset should be cited; just like with software papers, data papers are insufficient proxies for a particular dataset. The data paper should be included as citation for background information and attribution, while the dataset should be cited separately to support reproducibility and discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these high-level data products there is a very long tail of custom data products; they are mostly those that were made to support a particular publication. Some data centers support the creation of data bundles based on the selection of parts of larger datasets, often supporting the creation of a DOI for this custom bundle. Creating records for these as they get cited would result in opening the floodgates for indexed data products in SciX. Clearly, that would not be a desirable outcome. This is the part where we need to nuance the indexing criterion. This nuance will come in the form of a “reuse criterion”: only when a data product is cited a second time will a record be created. Figure 2 gives an indication of what to expect: it shows the citation count as a function of publication year for dataset records in NASA SciX. These are not the actual counts, currently in the system, but the estimated ones if we were to create a record for every cited DOI corresponding to a dataset. The actual counts are likely to be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_III_f2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Estimated citation count as a function of publication year for dataset records in SciX
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, there are about 179k of these datasets, but only 19k were cited more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves one last matter: the minimal metadata required and metadata quality. To support discoverability, a record needs a minimal set of attributes and these attributes need to be meaningful to a wider audience than just the creators of the data. Software records indexed from Zenodo offer some examples of the challenges: some author names are just represented by their Github handles and some records do not have an abstract, just a nondescript title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minimal set of desired attributes for software and data products is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Title&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abstract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publication date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Link to the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, having keywords would be great too, especially if they come from a controlled vocabulary or ontology (like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/uat-integration&quot;&gt;Unified Astronomy Thesaurus&lt;/a&gt;). Metadata quality is harder to check; clearly we do not do this for software records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can summarize the acceptance criteria for indexing data products as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the citation found is for a dataset already indexed in SciX: assign the new citation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the citation found is new and for a high-level/curated dataset: create record &amp;amp; assign citation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the dataset was cited for a second time: create record &amp;amp; assign both citations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third criterion is to prevent the floodgates effect, mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said earlier, the statement “publication contains a link to a dataset in the reference section” has a specific meaning: the citation must use the DOI of the data product. The simple reason is that any other URIs are not actionable because they do not have metadata associated with them that can be retrieved from a registry; given a DOI, all metadata can be harvested automatically from the repository where the DOI was registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;working-with-cited-data-in-scix&quot;&gt;Working with cited data in SciX&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once data products are indexed, a range of new discovery possibilities become possible. It depends on the target audience to what extent these possibilities are interesting or useful. On one end of the spectrum one could explore the context of a single data product, while on the other end, one can do this for a larger collection, e.g. all data products indexed for one repository. Indexed data products can also be grouped by other criteria, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a set of questions that be answered for data product records that are indexed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In what context is my data being used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In what (Open Access) publication venues is my data being cited?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where do researchers work who cite my data?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the citation and usage metrics for my data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions like these are relevant for individual researchers, but also for data, repository and mission managers. For archival data it will be particularly useful and interesting to use the scholarly network to see the impact it is having and whether it is being used as a stepping stone (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51g.105P/abstract&quot;&gt;Peek et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). It will also allow the study of trends in Open Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going into the specifics of these questions, we will first show some of the more general queries to discover and interact with indexed data products (see table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Question&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;SciX query&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all data product records&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;doctype:dataset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all records for data repository with DOI prefix 10.26033&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;doi:”10.26033/&lt;/em&gt;”*&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all records for data repository with DOI prefix 10.26033 with citations&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;* doi:”10.26033/&lt;em&gt;” has:citation_count&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all data products with a specific publication abbreviation (bibstem)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;bibstem:yCat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all data records that do not have a link to data&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;doctype:dataset -property:data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all records with a link to the PDS data archive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;data:PDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1: general queries for discovering indexed data products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate finding answers to questions about individual data products, we look at the following record already indexed in SciX: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2015ivs..data....1N/abstract&quot;&gt;“The IVS data input to ITRF2014”, published by GFZ Data Services, Helmoltz Centre, Potsdam, Germany&lt;/a&gt;. As of April 11 it has 46 citations. On the one hand, this dataset is relevant to VLBI observation, while on the other, it is relevant to geodesy, specifically to the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRF). Is this reflected in the context of those 46 citations? The results in figure 3 (created using the SciX paper network) highlight that some of them relate to astrometry, while others focus on the pure geodesy part. The &lt;em&gt;Publications&lt;/em&gt; facet shows a wide range in publication venues. Adding the filter &lt;em&gt;property:openaccess&lt;/em&gt; shows that about 50% of the citing works are Open Access. Since this data product comes with rich metadata, a useful venue for further discovery could be the use of the &lt;em&gt;similar()&lt;/em&gt; operator; based on textual similarity, what other records in NASA SciX could potentially be interesting if this data product is relevant to your research? Executing the query &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=similar(bibcode%3A2015ivs..data....1N)&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;similar(bibcode:2015ivs..data….1N)&lt;/a&gt; returns an extensive list of publications, many about VLBI, but also with wider geodesy applications. A narrower version of this query also returns interesting results: what data products or software records are similar to this data product? The query &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=similar(bibcode%3A2015ivs..data....1N)+doctype%3A(dataset+OR+software)&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;similar(bibcode:2015ivs..data….1N) doctype:(dataset OR software)&lt;/a&gt; will return these results. Naturally, many VizieR data catalogs are returned, but also a software records like &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2014ascl.soft03026I/abstract&quot;&gt;“SOFA: Standards of Fundamental Astronomy”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2019zndo...2565124L/abstract&quot;&gt;“liulei/volks: VOLKS: VLBI Observation for the Localization of frb Keen Searcher”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Paper network for the publications citing the data product &quot;The IVS data input to ITRF2014&quot;
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of indexed data products that is the most suitable to use as an example is that of VizieR data catalogs. In total there are currently 20,432 of these records with 10,361 total citations. VizieR provides the most complete library of published astronomical catalogs (tables and associated data) with verified and enriched data. Given the size of this collection and the limitations of the available analysis tools within SciX, we will explore a subset of these records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=topn(5000%2C+bibstem%3AyCat%2C+date+desc)&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;5,000 most recent VizieR data catalogs&lt;/a&gt;, we discover that they have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=citations(topn(5000%2C+bibstem%3AyCat%2C+date+desc))&amp;amp;sort=citation_count+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;cited by just under 800 publications&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=citations(topn(5000%2C+bibstem%3AyCat%2C+date+desc))+property%3A(openaccess+data)&amp;amp;sort=citation_count+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;close to 600 of these&lt;/a&gt; are Open Access publications with links to data. Figure 4 illustrates the range of topics covered by these publications by creating the Paper Network. The Publications facet for these citations shows that they mostly come from the well-known astronomy publication venues and the Institutions facet (see figure 4, right) indicates that the authors of the citing publications work at a wide range of locations. The citing publications are also represented in many  bibliographic groups (“bibgroups”); these are curated lists of publications for institutes, missions or instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, what is currently being supported in SciX in regards to the linking to and indexing of data products?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data linking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data links provided by collaborators and external curators are actively added&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data links are mined from full text provided by publishers known to support discoverable data links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data links are not indexed directly in SciX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data indexing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systematic indexing of data products for a few sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we plan to implement the following in addition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data linking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data product DOIs found in bibliographies will be used to create data links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data indexing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cited, high-level, curated data products will be indexed
Re-used data products will be indexed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when data products get indexed, any citations for them will get attributed to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in place, we will be able to say that SciX contains accurate representations of research life cycle products. Besides the scholarly publications, SciX will have records for conference proceedings and abstracts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Aproposal&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Asoftware&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Adataset&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;data products&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=property%3Adata&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;links to data&lt;/a&gt;. Next, we will be focussing on indexing grant funding information with the help of the publishers and organizations like Crossref and CHORUS, and the indispensable support of institutional and organizational librarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog is the final part in the series on data linking and indexing in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;Science Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (SciX). In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/data-linking-I&quot;&gt;first&lt;/a&gt; part we provided a general overview of the holdings in SciX, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/data-linking-II&quot;&gt;second&lt;/a&gt; part discussed the role and merits of linked data in this service.

A decade ago we included NASA Astrophysics grant funding proposals. In addition to these sources we are also systematically indexing records for datasets in the Planetary Data System (PDS) and datasets of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SciX is a publication-centric discovery platform, so it supports the discovery of research artifacts as they are linked to the scholarly literature. This informs the strategy for indexing data products: with exception of a certain class of data products, we will only index those that are formally cited in the scholarly literature. While true in principle, this statement needs to be made more explicit and nuanced. For one, we need to specify what we mean by a “certain class”. The nuance is needed for the “formally cited” part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “certain class” criterion relates to the fact that not all data products are created equal. There is a type of data product that is usually referred to as a “high-level science product”, or a “curated dataset”. These data products are almost like publications; in general they go through an extensive reviewing and curation process. It is this class of data products we have in mind for the “certain class” criterion for indexing. The aforementioned PDS datasets are an example of these curated data products. It is not uncommon for high-level science products to be accompanied by data publications: articles in refereed journals describing the data in detail. Often data centers and data authors prefer these articles to be cited, rather than the data product itself. This is typically done by including in a data product landing page a “cite as” statement recommending that a paper citation be used instead. However, reality has shown that these statements are not always followed. It is not clear whether this is the result of an author ignoring this statement or some information being lost during the journal’s copy-editing process. Having said this, the official SciX point of view is that when a data paper is available, both the paper and the dataset should be cited; just like with software papers, data papers are insufficient proxies for a particular dataset. The data paper should be included as citation for background information and attribution, while the dataset should be cited separately to support reproducibility and discoverability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides these high-level data products there is a very long tail of custom data products; they are mostly those that were made to support a particular publication. Some data centers support the creation of data bundles based on the selection of parts of larger datasets, often supporting the creation of a DOI for this custom bundle. Creating records for these as they get cited would result in opening the floodgates for indexed data products in SciX. Clearly, that would not be a desirable outcome. This is the part where we need to nuance the indexing criterion. This nuance will come in the form of a “reuse criterion”: only when a data product is cited a second time will a record be created. Figure 2 gives an indication of what to expect: it shows the citation count as a function of publication year for dataset records in NASA SciX. These are not the actual counts, currently in the system, but the estimated ones if we were to create a record for every cited DOI corresponding to a dataset. The actual counts are likely to be even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_III_f2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Estimated citation count as a function of publication year for dataset records in SciX
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total, there are about 179k of these datasets, but only 19k were cited more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves one last matter: the minimal metadata required and metadata quality. To support discoverability, a record needs a minimal set of attributes and these attributes need to be meaningful to a wider audience than just the creators of the data. Software records indexed from Zenodo offer some examples of the challenges: some author names are just represented by their Github handles and some records do not have an abstract, just a nondescript title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This minimal set of desired attributes for software and data products is the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Title&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Authors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abstract&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publication date&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Link to the data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, having keywords would be great too, especially if they come from a controlled vocabulary or ontology (like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/uat-integration&quot;&gt;Unified Astronomy Thesaurus&lt;/a&gt;). Metadata quality is harder to check; clearly we do not do this for software records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can summarize the acceptance criteria for indexing data products as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the citation found is for a dataset already indexed in SciX: assign the new citation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the citation found is new and for a high-level/curated dataset: create record &amp;amp; assign citation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the dataset was cited for a second time: create record &amp;amp; assign both citations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third criterion is to prevent the floodgates effect, mentioned earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As said earlier, the statement “publication contains a link to a dataset in the reference section” has a specific meaning: the citation must use the DOI of the data product. The simple reason is that any other URIs are not actionable because they do not have metadata associated with them that can be retrieved from a registry; given a DOI, all metadata can be harvested automatically from the repository where the DOI was registered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;working-with-cited-data-in-scix&quot;&gt;Working with cited data in SciX&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once data products are indexed, a range of new discovery possibilities become possible. It depends on the target audience to what extent these possibilities are interesting or useful. On one end of the spectrum one could explore the context of a single data product, while on the other end, one can do this for a larger collection, e.g. all data products indexed for one repository. Indexed data products can also be grouped by other criteria, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a set of questions that be answered for data product records that are indexed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In what context is my data being used?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In what (Open Access) publication venues is my data being cited?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where do researchers work who cite my data?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the citation and usage metrics for my data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions like these are relevant for individual researchers, but also for data, repository and mission managers. For archival data it will be particularly useful and interesting to use the scholarly network to see the impact it is having and whether it is being used as a stepping stone (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019BAAS...51g.105P/abstract&quot;&gt;Peek et al. 2019&lt;/a&gt;). It will also allow the study of trends in Open Science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before going into the specifics of these questions, we will first show some of the more general queries to discover and interact with indexed data products (see table 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Question&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;SciX query&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all data product records&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;doctype:dataset&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all records for data repository with DOI prefix 10.26033&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;doi:”10.26033/&lt;/em&gt;”*&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all records for data repository with DOI prefix 10.26033 with citations&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;* doi:”10.26033/&lt;em&gt;” has:citation_count&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all data products with a specific publication abbreviation (bibstem)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;bibstem:yCat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all data records that do not have a link to data&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;doctype:dataset -property:data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Find all records with a link to the PDS data archive&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;data:PDS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Table 1: general queries for discovering indexed data products&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate finding answers to questions about individual data products, we look at the following record already indexed in SciX: &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2015ivs..data....1N/abstract&quot;&gt;“The IVS data input to ITRF2014”, published by GFZ Data Services, Helmoltz Centre, Potsdam, Germany&lt;/a&gt;. As of April 11 it has 46 citations. On the one hand, this dataset is relevant to VLBI observation, while on the other, it is relevant to geodesy, specifically to the International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRF). Is this reflected in the context of those 46 citations? The results in figure 3 (created using the SciX paper network) highlight that some of them relate to astrometry, while others focus on the pure geodesy part. The &lt;em&gt;Publications&lt;/em&gt; facet shows a wide range in publication venues. Adding the filter &lt;em&gt;property:openaccess&lt;/em&gt; shows that about 50% of the citing works are Open Access. Since this data product comes with rich metadata, a useful venue for further discovery could be the use of the &lt;em&gt;similar()&lt;/em&gt; operator; based on textual similarity, what other records in NASA SciX could potentially be interesting if this data product is relevant to your research? Executing the query &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=similar(bibcode%3A2015ivs..data....1N)&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;similar(bibcode:2015ivs..data….1N)&lt;/a&gt; returns an extensive list of publications, many about VLBI, but also with wider geodesy applications. A narrower version of this query also returns interesting results: what data products or software records are similar to this data product? The query &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=similar(bibcode%3A2015ivs..data....1N)+doctype%3A(dataset+OR+software)&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;similar(bibcode:2015ivs..data….1N) doctype:(dataset OR software)&lt;/a&gt; will return these results. Naturally, many VizieR data catalogs are returned, but also a software records like &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2014ascl.soft03026I/abstract&quot;&gt;“SOFA: Standards of Fundamental Astronomy”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2019zndo...2565124L/abstract&quot;&gt;“liulei/volks: VOLKS: VLBI Observation for the Localization of frb Keen Searcher”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Paper network for the publications citing the data product &quot;The IVS data input to ITRF2014&quot;
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of indexed data products that is the most suitable to use as an example is that of VizieR data catalogs. In total there are currently 20,432 of these records with 10,361 total citations. VizieR provides the most complete library of published astronomical catalogs (tables and associated data) with verified and enriched data. Given the size of this collection and the limitations of the available analysis tools within SciX, we will explore a subset of these records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=topn(5000%2C+bibstem%3AyCat%2C+date+desc)&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;5,000 most recent VizieR data catalogs&lt;/a&gt;, we discover that they have been &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=citations(topn(5000%2C+bibstem%3AyCat%2C+date+desc))&amp;amp;sort=citation_count+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;cited by just under 800 publications&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=citations(topn(5000%2C+bibstem%3AyCat%2C+date+desc))+property%3A(openaccess+data)&amp;amp;sort=citation_count+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;close to 600 of these&lt;/a&gt; are Open Access publications with links to data. Figure 4 illustrates the range of topics covered by these publications by creating the Paper Network. The Publications facet for these citations shows that they mostly come from the well-known astronomy publication venues and the Institutions facet (see figure 4, right) indicates that the authors of the citing publications work at a wide range of locations. The citing publications are also represented in many  bibliographic groups (“bibgroups”); these are curated lists of publications for institutes, missions or instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, what is currently being supported in SciX in regards to the linking to and indexing of data products?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data linking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data links provided by collaborators and external curators are actively added&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data links are mined from full text provided by publishers known to support discoverable data links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data links are not indexed directly in SciX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data indexing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Systematic indexing of data products for a few sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the near future, we plan to implement the following in addition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data linking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data product DOIs found in bibliographies will be used to create data links&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data indexing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cited, high-level, curated data products will be indexed
Re-used data products will be indexed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, when data products get indexed, any citations for them will get attributed to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all of this in place, we will be able to say that SciX contains accurate representations of research life cycle products. Besides the scholarly publications, SciX will have records for conference proceedings and abstracts, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Aproposal&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;proposals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Asoftware&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=doctype%3Adataset&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;data products&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=property%3Adata&amp;amp;sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&amp;amp;p_=0&quot;&gt;links to data&lt;/a&gt;. Next, we will be focussing on indexing grant funding information with the help of the publishers and organizations like Crossref and CHORUS, and the indispensable support of institutional and organizational librarians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/data-linking-I&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of this blog series, we provided a general description of the holdings in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;Science Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (SciX); in this second part, we highlight a specific aspect of these holdings and place it in the context of the Research Life Cycle. The concept of a Research Life Cycle is not anything new; it represents the way in which scholarly research is done and has, in principle, not changed for a long time, probably centuries. It has fundamentally changed, however, in the way it is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these changes happened in the late 1990s: the introduction of electronic publishing of scholarly articles. In the same era, the discovery of these articles was also revolutionized with the introduction of the World Wide Web. Jumping to the here and the now, there is very little left in the Research Life Cycle that is not or cannot be expressed electronically. Let’s refer to these elements as “research artifacts”; each of these artifacts carries specific knowledge related to a specific stage of this life cycle. With the promotion of Open Science, there is a growing realization that this movement is best supported if these artifacts are accurately and formally represented in the process of exposing scholarly research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, scholarly articles were the sole means of exposing scholarly research; however, they just represent one aspect of this research: that of useful outcomes. Everything else that goes into and supports research is important too, especially within the context of preservation, reusability and reproducibility; this context is the purview of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&quot;&gt;FAIR Principles&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of other artifacts include data, software, proposals, and presentations. The overall goal of FAIR is to enhance the sharing, preservation and communication of data-intensive research (like Astronomy, Heliophysics, Earth Science and Space Sciences). In other words, the digital-born, scholarly articles now exist as entities linked to other electronic artifacts; it is up to publishers and discovery platforms, like SciX, to make these linkages possible electronically and discoverable. Perhaps to state the obvious: SciX is a publication-centric discovery platform, so it supports the discovery of research artifacts as they are linked to the scholarly literature. To search directly for specific data or software products a dedicated service will need to be used; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencediscoveryengine.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;NASA Science Discovery Engine&lt;/a&gt; is an example to search for NASA’s science data, documentation, and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the whole of the artifacts referenced by a scholarly article forms the best representation of the science discussed in the article, having a proper coverage of these sources will help in properly representing different aspects and stages of research life cycles. Just capturing citations to other scholarly publications would not only leave out important information, it would also omit proper attribution to researchers who contribute as authors of non-traditional research products. The Science Explorer has implemented a workflow for capturing software citations; this workflow allows the detection and ingestion of citations to software products used in scholarly publications. Since both data and software citations are crucial for the transparency of research results and for the transmission of credit, SciX will implement indexing of high-level and reused data products, in particular those published by NASA Archives, and track their citations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citations are just one form of the linkages we are referring to. Linkages are essentially so-called semantic triples (figure 2): a triple is a sequence of three entities that codifies a statement about semantic data in the form of subject–predicate–object expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicate describes the relationship between two entities, one the subject and the other the object. The relationship within the framework of SciX can be one of two: &lt;em&gt;cites&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt;. Also, within this framework, the subject always refers to a publication and currently the object refers to either a data product or software. At this point it is good to explain the difference between the treatment of these two relationships within the SciX context, in particular the consequences. Table 1 summarizes the difference between the two scenarios in SciX. The row “Form” corresponds to another limitation within SciX: only objects that have a URL associated with them can be considered; objects without URL are per definition not actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_t1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Difference between mentions and citations. In the case of cites, only DOIs are in principle actionable because they have harvestable metadata associated with them. Cites with other identifiers are actionable if the cited work is already indexed.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we focus on the cases where the object is a data product. In the next sections, we discuss the support of data links and data citations, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;linked-data-products&quot;&gt;Linked data products&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the distinguishing features of SciX is the presence of links from its records to research archives and databases. This is particularly significant for the core astronomy journals which work with archive curators to create and maintain rich online resources associated with the articles they publish. As an example, 70% of articles published in the main astronomy journals during 2023 have links to data products. Historically, the links have been created by curators upon the ingestion of datasets published with the article (as is the case for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=bibstem%3AyCat&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;VizieR data tables&lt;/a&gt;), cross-referencing of astronomical object measurements (SIMBAD and NED), or telescope bibliographies (Astrophysics Data Archives such as Chandra, MAST, IRSA, HEASARC, etc). The ADS, and now SciX, has been working with collaborators at these institutions to enable links between its records and these datasets on a regular basis, allowing for the curated links to be exposed to the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their response to the call for Open Science, many publishers have started to incorporate so-called Data Availability Statement sections in the articles they publish. We mine links from these sections for most journals we index from the AGU, Elsevier, Springer and the AAS. Currently we simply mine these links and do little curation. The only part that needs action from the SciX curation team is the fact that we label these links for their display in the ADS user interface (figure 3). At this moment, these labels are based on heuristics. For example, certain DOI prefixes can be associated uniquely with a particular repository, just like some URL patterns. As of the writing of this blog, we have mined about 110k links this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;working-with-linked-data-in-scix&quot;&gt;Working with linked data in SciX&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the only discovery tools at your disposal are the ability to find records that have linked data in general or linked data associated with a particular data source (if you happen to know the abbreviation used in SciX). For any additional filtering you will need to use circumstantial evidence using other SciX search fields. The query &lt;em&gt;property:data&lt;/em&gt; will find records that linked data associated with them in general, while the query &lt;em&gt;data:MAST&lt;/em&gt; will find records with data products hosted at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST); some labels used in SciX for data links are obvious (e.g. when they are the same as the acronym of the data center). Whenever we were unable to assign a descriptive label to a data link, we assigned the vanilla label &lt;em&gt;DATASOURCE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good strategy for finding data sources associated with a particular topic is to do a general search on that topic and filter the results on records that link to data (&lt;em&gt;property:data&lt;/em&gt;). For example, if you are interested in carbonaceous chondrites in the context of the Moon, you can query &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=Lunar+carbonaceous+chondrites&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;Lunar carbonaceous chondrites&lt;/a&gt; and find close to 1,500 records; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=Lunar+carbonaceous+chondrites+property%3Adata&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;n=10&quot;&gt;adding the filter property:data&lt;/a&gt; will limit this set to 68 records. Opening the &lt;em&gt;Data&lt;/em&gt; facet will show that most records are associated with the label &lt;em&gt;Astromat&lt;/em&gt;; this label corresponds to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astromat.org/&quot;&gt;NASA Astromaterials Data System&lt;/a&gt;. A little bit more insight can be obtained by switching on the highlights for this search. Finding records that link a publication to a specific data product is currently not supported. If you happen to know a uniquely identifying string or phrase for that data product, you could try doing a full text search. For example, if you try to find mentions of various versions of the PDS dataset identified by &lt;em&gt;urn:nasa:pds:ast-lightcurve-database&lt;/em&gt;, you can run the query&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=full%3A%22urn%3Anasa%3Apds%3Aast-lightcurve-database%22&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;n=10&quot;&gt;full:”urn:nasa:pds:ast-lightcurve-database”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though SciX does not offer ways to find links to specific data products, the service does provide a powerful discovery environment to explore the context for data associated with or generated in specific missions, by certain instruments, for particular science topics or hosted in a certain repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first example we will explore the science topics covered by refereed Open Access publications, with links to data, that mention the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/legacy/nicmos&quot;&gt;Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer&lt;/a&gt; (NICMOS) in their title, abstract or keywords:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=NICMOS+property%3A(data+refereed+openaccess)+&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;NICMOS property:(data refereed openaccess)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Author&lt;/em&gt; facet will show you the most prolific authors associated with these publications, one of whom is Marcia Rieke who recently was awarded the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some insight into the science topics covered by these publications we generate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search/paper_network?q=NICMOS+property%3A%28data+refereed+openaccess%29+&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;Paper Network&lt;/a&gt;. By default, this network is generated for the first 400 publications; some additional details can be generated by increasing this amount (with a maximum of 1,000) and regenerating this network diagram. Figure 4 (left) shows the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram shows a number of high level science topics. The exploration does not need to end here; if one’s particular interest is circumstellar disks and protoplanetary nebulae, the results can be explored further by clicking on the blue segment, clicking on the button “Add to filter” (to the right of the Group 1 header) and hitting the search button. This generates an overview of just the publications in this group. If there are sufficient publications in this group, we can generate another Paper Network. This second network splits the original, larger category up into smaller, more detailed segments, providing more insight into the topics covered (figure 4, right diagram).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way we can explore the use of data links from a specific data repository. The following query returns all refereed, Open Access publications, published in the period 2020-2024 with a link to data available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noaa.gov/&quot;&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=data%3ANOAA+property%3A(refereed+openaccess)+year%3A2020-2024&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;data:NOAA property:(refereed openaccess) year:2020-2024
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like before, the Paper Network can be used to indicate the range of topics discussed in the publications returned by the query. Figure 5 shows the results for data hosted at NOAA (left) and data hosted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center, as an additional example (right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next example is to illustrate how to find publications that may be able to provide us with data products if we are interested in building on existing research in a particular topic. As a topic we select exoplanet atmospheres and we will start our exploration with recent, refereed Open Access publications, with links to data. The following query will generate the publications that correspond to this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=%22exoplanet+atmosphere%22+property%3A(refereed+data+openaccess)+year%3A2020-2024&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;fq_selection=(docs(cb91d308eb354bbc3a9b0b62b92b79c5))&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;fq=%7B%21type%3Daqp+v%3D%24fq_selection%7D&quot;&gt;“exoplanet atmosphere” property:(refereed data openaccess) year:2020-2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are shown in figure 6. The diagram on the left shows the results for the initial query and the diagram on the right shows the results when we generate the paper network for the publications in the orange segment only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the powerful SciX query language allows us to find Open Access, refereed publications, from the period 2010-2023, in the Earth Science collection, which have at least one link to data and cite at least one software product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;property:(refereed openaccess data) year:2010-2023 citations(doctype:software) collection:earthscience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixblog/data-linking-I&quot;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt; of this blog series, we provided a general description of the holdings in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;Science Explorer&lt;/a&gt; (SciX); in this second part, we highlight a specific aspect of these holdings and place it in the context of the Research Life Cycle. The concept of a Research Life Cycle is not anything new; it represents the way in which scholarly research is done and has, in principle, not changed for a long time, probably centuries. It has fundamentally changed, however, in the way it is expressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first of these changes happened in the late 1990s: the introduction of electronic publishing of scholarly articles. In the same era, the discovery of these articles was also revolutionized with the introduction of the World Wide Web. Jumping to the here and the now, there is very little left in the Research Life Cycle that is not or cannot be expressed electronically. Let’s refer to these elements as “research artifacts”; each of these artifacts carries specific knowledge related to a specific stage of this life cycle. With the promotion of Open Science, there is a growing realization that this movement is best supported if these artifacts are accurately and formally represented in the process of exposing scholarly research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, scholarly articles were the sole means of exposing scholarly research; however, they just represent one aspect of this research: that of useful outcomes. Everything else that goes into and supports research is important too, especially within the context of preservation, reusability and reproducibility; this context is the purview of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&quot;&gt;FAIR Principles&lt;/a&gt;. Examples of other artifacts include data, software, proposals, and presentations. The overall goal of FAIR is to enhance the sharing, preservation and communication of data-intensive research (like Astronomy, Heliophysics, Earth Science and Space Sciences). In other words, the digital-born, scholarly articles now exist as entities linked to other electronic artifacts; it is up to publishers and discovery platforms, like SciX, to make these linkages possible electronically and discoverable. Perhaps to state the obvious: SciX is a publication-centric discovery platform, so it supports the discovery of research artifacts as they are linked to the scholarly literature. To search directly for specific data or software products a dedicated service will need to be used; the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sciencediscoveryengine.nasa.gov/&quot;&gt;NASA Science Discovery Engine&lt;/a&gt; is an example to search for NASA’s science data, documentation, and code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the whole of the artifacts referenced by a scholarly article forms the best representation of the science discussed in the article, having a proper coverage of these sources will help in properly representing different aspects and stages of research life cycles. Just capturing citations to other scholarly publications would not only leave out important information, it would also omit proper attribution to researchers who contribute as authors of non-traditional research products. The Science Explorer has implemented a workflow for capturing software citations; this workflow allows the detection and ingestion of citations to software products used in scholarly publications. Since both data and software citations are crucial for the transparency of research results and for the transmission of credit, SciX will implement indexing of high-level and reused data products, in particular those published by NASA Archives, and track their citations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citations are just one form of the linkages we are referring to. Linkages are essentially so-called semantic triples (figure 2): a triple is a sequence of three entities that codifies a statement about semantic data in the form of subject–predicate–object expressions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predicate describes the relationship between two entities, one the subject and the other the object. The relationship within the framework of SciX can be one of two: &lt;em&gt;cites&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;mentions&lt;/em&gt;. Also, within this framework, the subject always refers to a publication and currently the object refers to either a data product or software. At this point it is good to explain the difference between the treatment of these two relationships within the SciX context, in particular the consequences. Table 1 summarizes the difference between the two scenarios in SciX. The row “Form” corresponds to another limitation within SciX: only objects that have a URL associated with them can be considered; objects without URL are per definition not actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_t1.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Difference between mentions and citations. In the case of cites, only DOIs are in principle actionable because they have harvestable metadata associated with them. Cites with other identifiers are actionable if the cited work is already indexed.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we focus on the cases where the object is a data product. In the next sections, we discuss the support of data links and data citations, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;linked-data-products&quot;&gt;Linked data products&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the distinguishing features of SciX is the presence of links from its records to research archives and databases. This is particularly significant for the core astronomy journals which work with archive curators to create and maintain rich online resources associated with the articles they publish. As an example, 70% of articles published in the main astronomy journals during 2023 have links to data products. Historically, the links have been created by curators upon the ingestion of datasets published with the article (as is the case for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=bibstem%3AyCat&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;VizieR data tables&lt;/a&gt;), cross-referencing of astronomical object measurements (SIMBAD and NED), or telescope bibliographies (Astrophysics Data Archives such as Chandra, MAST, IRSA, HEASARC, etc). The ADS, and now SciX, has been working with collaborators at these institutions to enable links between its records and these datasets on a regular basis, allowing for the curated links to be exposed to the end user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f3.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their response to the call for Open Science, many publishers have started to incorporate so-called Data Availability Statement sections in the articles they publish. We mine links from these sections for most journals we index from the AGU, Elsevier, Springer and the AAS. Currently we simply mine these links and do little curation. The only part that needs action from the SciX curation team is the fact that we label these links for their display in the ADS user interface (figure 3). At this moment, these labels are based on heuristics. For example, certain DOI prefixes can be associated uniquely with a particular repository, just like some URL patterns. As of the writing of this blog, we have mined about 110k links this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;working-with-linked-data-in-scix&quot;&gt;Working with linked data in SciX&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the only discovery tools at your disposal are the ability to find records that have linked data in general or linked data associated with a particular data source (if you happen to know the abbreviation used in SciX). For any additional filtering you will need to use circumstantial evidence using other SciX search fields. The query &lt;em&gt;property:data&lt;/em&gt; will find records that linked data associated with them in general, while the query &lt;em&gt;data:MAST&lt;/em&gt; will find records with data products hosted at the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST); some labels used in SciX for data links are obvious (e.g. when they are the same as the acronym of the data center). Whenever we were unable to assign a descriptive label to a data link, we assigned the vanilla label &lt;em&gt;DATASOURCE&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good strategy for finding data sources associated with a particular topic is to do a general search on that topic and filter the results on records that link to data (&lt;em&gt;property:data&lt;/em&gt;). For example, if you are interested in carbonaceous chondrites in the context of the Moon, you can query &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=Lunar+carbonaceous+chondrites&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;Lunar carbonaceous chondrites&lt;/a&gt; and find close to 1,500 records; &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=Lunar+carbonaceous+chondrites+property%3Adata&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;n=10&quot;&gt;adding the filter property:data&lt;/a&gt; will limit this set to 68 records. Opening the &lt;em&gt;Data&lt;/em&gt; facet will show that most records are associated with the label &lt;em&gt;Astromat&lt;/em&gt;; this label corresponds to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.astromat.org/&quot;&gt;NASA Astromaterials Data System&lt;/a&gt;. A little bit more insight can be obtained by switching on the highlights for this search. Finding records that link a publication to a specific data product is currently not supported. If you happen to know a uniquely identifying string or phrase for that data product, you could try doing a full text search. For example, if you try to find mentions of various versions of the PDS dataset identified by &lt;em&gt;urn:nasa:pds:ast-lightcurve-database&lt;/em&gt;, you can run the query&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=full%3A%22urn%3Anasa%3Apds%3Aast-lightcurve-database%22&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;n=10&quot;&gt;full:”urn:nasa:pds:ast-lightcurve-database”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though SciX does not offer ways to find links to specific data products, the service does provide a powerful discovery environment to explore the context for data associated with or generated in specific missions, by certain instruments, for particular science topics or hosted in a certain repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first example we will explore the science topics covered by refereed Open Access publications, with links to data, that mention the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/legacy/nicmos&quot;&gt;Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer&lt;/a&gt; (NICMOS) in their title, abstract or keywords:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=NICMOS+property%3A(data+refereed+openaccess)+&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;NICMOS property:(data refereed openaccess)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Author&lt;/em&gt; facet will show you the most prolific authors associated with these publications, one of whom is Marcia Rieke who recently was awarded the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get some insight into the science topics covered by these publications we generate the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search/paper_network?q=NICMOS+property%3A%28data+refereed+openaccess%29+&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;Paper Network&lt;/a&gt;. By default, this network is generated for the first 400 publications; some additional details can be generated by increasing this amount (with a maximum of 1,000) and regenerating this network diagram. Figure 4 (left) shows the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f4.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The diagram shows a number of high level science topics. The exploration does not need to end here; if one’s particular interest is circumstellar disks and protoplanetary nebulae, the results can be explored further by clicking on the blue segment, clicking on the button “Add to filter” (to the right of the Group 1 header) and hitting the search button. This generates an overview of just the publications in this group. If there are sufficient publications in this group, we can generate another Paper Network. This second network splits the original, larger category up into smaller, more detailed segments, providing more insight into the topics covered (figure 4, right diagram).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a similar way we can explore the use of data links from a specific data repository. The following query returns all refereed, Open Access publications, published in the period 2020-2024 with a link to data available at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.noaa.gov/&quot;&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=data%3ANOAA+property%3A(refereed+openaccess)+year%3A2020-2024&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;p=1&quot;&gt;data:NOAA property:(refereed openaccess) year:2020-2024
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like before, the Paper Network can be used to indicate the range of topics discussed in the publications returned by the query. Figure 5 shows the results for data hosted at NOAA (left) and data hosted at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center, as an additional example (right).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f5.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next example is to illustrate how to find publications that may be able to provide us with data products if we are interested in building on existing research in a particular topic. As a topic we select exoplanet atmospheres and we will start our exploration with recent, refereed Open Access publications, with links to data. The following query will generate the publications that correspond to this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/search?q=%22exoplanet+atmosphere%22+property%3A(refereed+data+openaccess)+year%3A2020-2024&amp;amp;sort=score+desc%2Cdate+desc&amp;amp;fq_selection=(docs(cb91d308eb354bbc3a9b0b62b92b79c5))&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;fq=%7B%21type%3Daqp+v%3D%24fq_selection%7D&quot;&gt;“exoplanet atmosphere” property:(refereed data openaccess) year:2020-2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results are shown in figure 6. The diagram on the left shows the results for the initial query and the diagram on the right shows the results when we generate the paper network for the publications in the orange segment only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_II_f6.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the powerful SciX query language allows us to find Open Access, refereed publications, from the period 2010-2023, in the Earth Science collection, which have at least one link to data and cite at least one software product:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;property:(refereed openaccess data) year:2010-2023 citations(doctype:software) collection:earthscience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the distinguishing features of the Science Explorer (SciX) is its integration of literature with research data, software, and services. SciX records accrue links to related research objects through curated text mining (finding citations and links to data and software in the publisher manuscript) and metadata enrichment (aggregating bibliographies maintained by missions and archives). Our work with community-led initiatives such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/asclepias&quot;&gt;Asclepias&lt;/a&gt; project and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascl.net/&quot;&gt;Astrophysics Source Code Library&lt;/a&gt; have put ADS at the forefront of the FAIR efforts in the physical sciences. SciX extends these efforts to the remaining NASA Science disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

The different shapes represent different resources (articles, data, software) and the different colored arrows represent relationships (like cites, supplements,...). Some of these links, like &quot;record A cites record B&quot; (e.g. the black arrows) only have meaning within SciX, because it is a relationship between two entities that only exist within SciX.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Before going into a discussion of how data products are linked to and indexed in SciX, we will first examine how data is represented in SciX itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By executing a query in SciX, users enter a nexus between scientists, research products (like publications) and a wealth of information these records are linked to, both internally and externally. SciX supports the discovery of high level science results and the evidence which they are built on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The holdings of SciX can be represented as a graph, illustrated by figure 1. The nodes are digital objects, each representing research products (like journal articles, preprints, data products, software and multimedia presentations). The arrows represent relationships between the nodes; for example, an arrow can represent the relation “cites”, “is supplement to”, “is erratum for” or “is version of”. The blue circle represents the SciX holdings: everything within this circle has a representation in the SciX holdings in the form of a record, while everything outside this circle represents external information. The external information consists of digital objects that can be linked to SciX records by URIs. For example, a SciX record can have a link to a data product, hosted in an external repository, or to a document hosted elsewhere as supplementary information to an article in SciX. Linking can also happen in the other direction; for example, a platform like Wikipedia has many records with links to records in SciX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By construction links can, in principle, point to a resource outside of SciX, with the exception of two relationships that represent the following: “citations” and “co-readership”, both of which are only meaningful within SciX context. With this relation both the source and the target must correspond with nodes that lie within the circle in figure 1. The nodes within the circle represent what is indexed in SciX; these are actual, searchable database records, and their metrics (such as citations and reads) are tracked by SciX. Linked resources are not searchable, but they can provide a means for filtering search results. As an example, software packages cited in the literature are indexed records, which means you can use a SciX search to find all packages written by a particular researcher or cited more than N times. On the other hand, data products hosted by NASA archives are linked resources. While you can’t discover them with a search, you can find all the SciX records which link to one or more data products hosted by a particular archive such as MAST, Chandra, or SIMBAD. Table 1 summarizes the differences between indexed and linked information in SciX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Table 1: Highlights of differences between what is indexed versus what is linked to in SciX.
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SciX curation team receives digital assets (metadata, fulltext, relational data) from a range of sources and in a great variety of formats (ranging from simple ASCII text to highly structured XML data). These sources consist of collaborators (publishers, repositories, societies), users (missing publications, corrections, associations), other sources (mostly Crossref and DataCite) and SciX itself (even though internal, curated records are still a form of data supply, from a workflow perspective). These assets contain information that, down the line, need to become discoverable through the SciX user interface; to make this possible, we need an intricate process of extracting all the necessary elements from the original assets and putting them into a form that can be processed further. This workflow is made possible by format-specific parsers and the SciX &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/adsabs/ingest_data_model&quot;&gt;ingest data model&lt;/a&gt;. Since data is often not perfectly formatted, the curation process in the ETL layer needs to be able to deal with all kinds of issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;img-thumbnail&quot; src=&quot;/blog/images/data_linking_I_f2.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The augmentation layer enriches the original data with all kinds of information. In addition to making publications discoverable, SciX also maintains a citation graph. This graph is the result of the reference matching software in the augmentation layer; this framework takes reference data, either supplied or extracted, and attempts to match these to existing SciX records. The affiliation pipeline normalizes affiliations into canonical formats (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/affils-update&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;). The mining of data links will be discussed in part II of this series. The software citation capture was discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/asclepias&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;. The preprint matching process (called “docmatching”) is highlighted in &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/docmatcher&quot;&gt;this blog&lt;/a&gt;. We are developing  a process that tags publications with planetary feature names, taken from the USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/abs/2023arXiv231208579S/abstract&quot;&gt;this publication&lt;/a&gt;). Future augmentations will include a pipeline that will assign publications to one of the disciplines represented in SciX (document classifier) and a pipeline that will assign terms from the Unified Astronomy Thesaurus (UAT tagger), whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we have a lot of curated and augmented data, stored in various places. The next layer contains processes that consolidate all related assets into one canonical data unit, ready to be consumed by the indexing process. One service that SciX offers is the merging of preprint records with their associated published article records; the docmatching process identifies these correspondences and the import layer takes care of the record merging. Sometimes we receive metadata for one publication from multiple sources; the import layer takes care of merging these records according to specific rules. The final step in the Import Layer is the Master Pipeline orchestrating the merging of all these disparate data assets into a form that can be ingested and indexed in the final layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a couple of words about the general philosophy behind SciX. SciX is primarily a literature database, and as such it does not aim to be an index for all digital assets generated in scholarly research (like data products and software). However, one of the goals in SciX is to make those digital assets relevant that are discoverable from the literature, whenever feasible, for example when they are cited. In the next two parts of this blog we focus on one particular class of these digital assets: data products.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the distinguishing features of the Science Explorer (SciX) is its integration of literature with research data, software, and services. SciX records accrue links to related research objects through curated text mining (finding citations and links to data and software in the publisher manuscript) and metadata enrichment (aggregating bibliographies maintained by missions and archives). Our work with community-led initiatives such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/asclepias&quot;&gt;Asclepias&lt;/a&gt; project and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ascl.net/&quot;&gt;Astrophysics Source Code Library&lt;/a&gt; have put ADS at the forefront of the FAIR efforts in the physical sciences. SciX extends these efforts to the remaining NASA Science disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Historic Observatory Publications
&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 
Through the mid-20th century, many observatories had their own outlets for disseminating their research and administrative information. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=RGAO.&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=3&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Astronomical Observations made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=AnOLL&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=0&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Annals of the Private Observatory of Lucien Libert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=BuBIH&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=0&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Bulletin Horaire du Bureau International de l’Heur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=YalOY&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=1&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Yale University Observatory Reports for the year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are among those available through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;Science Explorer (SciX)&lt;/a&gt;. Astronomers reported their work in observatory periodicals and reviewed journals. These historic records contain foundational work that remains relevant today, observational data of unrepeatable sky views, and evidence of the evolving culture of astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three decades, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/about/history/&quot;&gt;Astrophysics Data System (ADS)&lt;/a&gt; served as the digital library for astronomy and astrophysics. Consequently, ADS indexed, linked to, and, when allowed, hosted scanned versions of historic observatory publications enabling everyone to find and access their contents. For our initial collection, we partnered with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib&quot;&gt;John G. Wolbach Library&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp;amp; Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;. The librarians there and at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Our-Commands/United-States-Naval-Observatory/The-James-M-Gilliss-Library/&quot;&gt;James M. Gillis Library&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/usno/&quot;&gt;US Naval Observatory&lt;/a&gt; prioritized scanning observatory publications with complete runs available. The results were stored on 35-mm film, which ADS, in turn, digitized to produce the files we now host on our servers. We entrusted one copy of the films to each library. Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixabout/&quot;&gt;SciX&lt;/a&gt; has assumed responsibility for this important legacy literature collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SciX continues to digitize legacy materials as we receive them. Librarians and researchers send us publications as they reduce their collections. Small astronomy organizations have asked us to become their repository. We estimate our historic astronomy literature collection is over 80% complete. We measure completeness by the fraction of papers that are referenced articles in the core astronomy and astrophysics journals for which we have entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you possess material relevant to astronomy and astrophysics that is missing from our collection, please let us know. Together, we can ensure the historic literature of astronomy is free and accessible to everyone. To confirm we are missing an article, please search our collections using either the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;ADS search interface&lt;/a&gt; or beta &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;SciX search interface&lt;/a&gt;. You should also review the &lt;a href=&quot;https://adsabs.harvard.edu/historical.html&quot;&gt;Historical scans currently in the ADS&lt;/a&gt; listing of publications and volumes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant publications include scholarly articles written in English in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and related disciplines. Including articles on the history of these fields or related bibliographies is possible. If you are unsure, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;help@scixplorer.org&quot;&gt;our curation team&lt;/a&gt; to discuss a specific item. The SciX curators determine the relevancy of articles and publications in accordance with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/journal_inclusion&quot;&gt;inclusion policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/ads_curation_model&quot;&gt;curation model&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrated user requirements, and funding guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because SciX scanning is destructive, your institution may prefer to scan materials in-house and send us the files for inclusion. If so, the proposed material must meet both our relevancy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/ScanHistLit&quot;&gt;technical standards&lt;/a&gt;. Please contact the &lt;a href=&quot;help@scixplorer.org&quot;&gt;SciX curators&lt;/a&gt; before beginning your project to be certain we can accommodate your proposal. In essence, SciX requires that you scan each page at a resolution of 600 dpi and save it as a single TIFF file. You scan every journal &lt;strong&gt;cover-to-cover&lt;/strong&gt; with no pages skipped (even the blank ones). Our detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/ScanHistLit&quot;&gt;technical standards&lt;/a&gt; offer specific guidance for pages with different content: text and line art, gray-scale images, or color images. We have naming conventions for files based on the type of page represented: regular, letter, insert, plate, front matter, or back matter. As an alternative to using our naming conventions, you can substitute a lookup-table that maps your file names into our scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer that SciX not host your files, we can link from our index record to an open access version hosted by your institution. For stability and interoperability, we prefer, but do not insist, that such items have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doi.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Object Identifier (DOI)&lt;/a&gt;. If you have publications without DOIs, we may be able to register them for you. Without the full text of an article, then SciX searches will only consider the metadata that we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, SciX needs copyright permission from the publisher or the institutional owner of the work to provide the full-text of scanned documents. We require a letter from the copyright holder which describes the content of the publications and gives SciX at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/about/about-smithsonian-astrophysical-observatory&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory&lt;/a&gt; permission to convert the files, to add an acknowledgement statement on each page and to make the images available electronically free of charge. Without permission, we can still index an article and link to an institutional site that hosts the material. Again, we prefer linking to scans with an associated DOI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to completeness, SciX considers the degree to which we cover an article. Minimal coverage means we have basic metadata: journal, volume, page, author, name, and title. Higher levels of coverage require that we have the abstract, the reference list, and the full text. For the historic literature, we may have the full text but not have extracted the abstract or the reference list. We welcome improvements to our metadata, which you can submit using the Feedback form linked in our page headers and at the bottom of every abstract view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitizing historic documents makes their contents more &lt;a href=&quot;https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/&quot;&gt;findable and accessible&lt;/a&gt;. However, it does not eliminate the need to keep physical reference copies. A researcher may need to review the originals if the illustrations or charts are unclear. As technology improves, re-scanning items to modern standards may be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically, no institution can maintain and preserve forever every document it receives. With limited resources, a decision to preserve one item is a decision to let another go. Every institution has its own collections policy that governs such choices. Deciding to deaccession or discard an item should consider more factors than its presence in SciX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If SciX indexes a paper and your institution no longer needs it, consider passing it along to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.archive.org/help/how-do-i-make-a-physical-donation-to-the-internet-archive/&quot;&gt;accept, digitize, and store physical items&lt;/a&gt; that are not already in their collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SciX exists to assist scientists in finding and accessing the concentrated knowledge of science, which is distilled and revealed in the scholarly literature, modern and ancient. The research of our predecessors shapes and supports our current efforts. We stand less on the shoulders of giants and more on the piles of their publications. Explore the historic literature in SciX, what you discover will be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

Through the mid-20th century, many observatories had their own outlets for disseminating their research and administrative information. &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=RGAO.&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=3&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Astronomical Observations made at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=AnOLL&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=0&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Annals of the Private Observatory of Lucien Libert&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=BuBIH&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=0&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Bulletin Horaire du Bureau International de l’Heur&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?journal=YalOY&amp;amp;year=%3f%3f%3f%3f&amp;amp;volume=...1&amp;amp;letter=.&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;page_ind=1&amp;amp;plate_select=NO&amp;amp;data_type=GIF&amp;amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;amp;classic=YES&quot;&gt;Yale University Observatory Reports for the year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are among those available through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;Science Explorer (SciX)&lt;/a&gt;. Astronomers reported their work in observatory periodicals and reviewed journals. These historic records contain foundational work that remains relevant today, observational data of unrepeatable sky views, and evidence of the evolving culture of astronomy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three decades, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/about/history/&quot;&gt;Astrophysics Data System (ADS)&lt;/a&gt; served as the digital library for astronomy and astrophysics. Consequently, ADS indexed, linked to, and, when allowed, hosted scanned versions of historic observatory publications enabling everyone to find and access their contents. For our initial collection, we partnered with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/lib&quot;&gt;John G. Wolbach Library&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp;amp; Smithsonian&lt;/a&gt;. The librarians there and at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/Our-Commands/United-States-Naval-Observatory/The-James-M-Gilliss-Library/&quot;&gt;James M. Gillis Library&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnmoc.usff.navy.mil/usno/&quot;&gt;US Naval Observatory&lt;/a&gt; prioritized scanning observatory publications with complete runs available. The results were stored on 35-mm film, which ADS, in turn, digitized to produce the files we now host on our servers. We entrusted one copy of the films to each library. Now, &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/scixabout/&quot;&gt;SciX&lt;/a&gt; has assumed responsibility for this important legacy literature collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SciX continues to digitize legacy materials as we receive them. Librarians and researchers send us publications as they reduce their collections. Small astronomy organizations have asked us to become their repository. We estimate our historic astronomy literature collection is over 80% complete. We measure completeness by the fraction of papers that are referenced articles in the core astronomy and astrophysics journals for which we have entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you possess material relevant to astronomy and astrophysics that is missing from our collection, please let us know. Together, we can ensure the historic literature of astronomy is free and accessible to everyone. To confirm we are missing an article, please search our collections using either the traditional &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/&quot;&gt;ADS search interface&lt;/a&gt; or beta &lt;a href=&quot;https://scixplorer.org/&quot;&gt;SciX search interface&lt;/a&gt;. You should also review the &lt;a href=&quot;https://adsabs.harvard.edu/historical.html&quot;&gt;Historical scans currently in the ADS&lt;/a&gt; listing of publications and volumes available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relevant publications include scholarly articles written in English in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and related disciplines. Including articles on the history of these fields or related bibliographies is possible. If you are unsure, please contact &lt;a href=&quot;help@scixplorer.org&quot;&gt;our curation team&lt;/a&gt; to discuss a specific item. The SciX curators determine the relevancy of articles and publications in accordance with our &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/journal_inclusion&quot;&gt;inclusion policy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/ads_curation_model&quot;&gt;curation model&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrated user requirements, and funding guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because SciX scanning is destructive, your institution may prefer to scan materials in-house and send us the files for inclusion. If so, the proposed material must meet both our relevancy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/ScanHistLit&quot;&gt;technical standards&lt;/a&gt;. Please contact the &lt;a href=&quot;help@scixplorer.org&quot;&gt;SciX curators&lt;/a&gt; before beginning your project to be certain we can accommodate your proposal. In essence, SciX requires that you scan each page at a resolution of 600 dpi and save it as a single TIFF file. You scan every journal &lt;strong&gt;cover-to-cover&lt;/strong&gt; with no pages skipped (even the blank ones). Our detailed &lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/data_faq/ScanHistLit&quot;&gt;technical standards&lt;/a&gt; offer specific guidance for pages with different content: text and line art, gray-scale images, or color images. We have naming conventions for files based on the type of page represented: regular, letter, insert, plate, front matter, or back matter. As an alternative to using our naming conventions, you can substitute a lookup-table that maps your file names into our scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you prefer that SciX not host your files, we can link from our index record to an open access version hosted by your institution. For stability and interoperability, we prefer, but do not insist, that such items have a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.doi.org/&quot;&gt;Digital Object Identifier (DOI)&lt;/a&gt;. If you have publications without DOIs, we may be able to register them for you. Without the full text of an article, then SciX searches will only consider the metadata that we have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, SciX needs copyright permission from the publisher or the institutional owner of the work to provide the full-text of scanned documents. We require a letter from the copyright holder which describes the content of the publications and gives SciX at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/about/about-smithsonian-astrophysical-observatory&quot;&gt;Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory&lt;/a&gt; permission to convert the files, to add an acknowledgement statement on each page and to make the images available electronically free of charge. Without permission, we can still index an article and link to an institutional site that hosts the material. Again, we prefer linking to scans with an associated DOI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to completeness, SciX considers the degree to which we cover an article. Minimal coverage means we have basic metadata: journal, volume, page, author, name, and title. Higher levels of coverage require that we have the abstract, the reference list, and the full text. For the historic literature, we may have the full text but not have extracted the abstract or the reference list. We welcome improvements to our metadata, which you can submit using the Feedback form linked in our page headers and at the bottom of every abstract view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digitizing historic documents makes their contents more &lt;a href=&quot;https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/&quot;&gt;findable and accessible&lt;/a&gt;. However, it does not eliminate the need to keep physical reference copies. A researcher may need to review the originals if the illustrations or charts are unclear. As technology improves, re-scanning items to modern standards may be desirable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Realistically, no institution can maintain and preserve forever every document it receives. With limited resources, a decision to preserve one item is a decision to let another go. Every institution has its own collections policy that governs such choices. Deciding to deaccession or discard an item should consider more factors than its presence in SciX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If SciX indexes a paper and your institution no longer needs it, consider passing it along to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://archive.org/&quot;&gt;Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;. They &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.archive.org/help/how-do-i-make-a-physical-donation-to-the-internet-archive/&quot;&gt;accept, digitize, and store physical items&lt;/a&gt; that are not already in their collections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SciX exists to assist scientists in finding and accessing the concentrated knowledge of science, which is distilled and revealed in the scholarly literature, modern and ancient. The research of our predecessors shapes and supports our current efforts. We stand less on the shoulders of giants and more on the piles of their publications. Explore the historic literature in SciX, what you discover will be amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
