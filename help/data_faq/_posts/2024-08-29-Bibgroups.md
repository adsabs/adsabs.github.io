### What are Bibgroups? 
Bibgroups are libraries that are curated by librarians, archivists and scientists who are not ADS/SciX employees. Descriptions of each bibgroup include information that details the coverage in the collection and frequency of updates.  Many of the bibgroups include contact information for the maintainer. We maintain links to [ADS legacy bibgroups](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/legacy/#ads-legacy-bibgroups) that are no longer updated but contain useful information.

### CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaiʻi Telescope)
`bibgroup:CFHT`  This bibliographic group includes peer reviewed papers by researchers worldwide using data from the [Canada-France-Hawaiʻi Telescope (CFHT)](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu). CFHT is located on Maunakea, land of the Kānaka Maoli people, and a mountain of considerable cultural, natural and ecological significance to the Indigenous Hawaiian people. It comprises all papers utilizing every instrument ever used at CFHT, dating back to 1979 when the first CFHT paper was published. The CFHT community consists primarily of scientists from Canada, France and the University of Hawaiʻi, and from institutions in Taiwan, China, Brazil and Korea, though research teams often include members outside this community. The list also features papers using [archival data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/Ck5RwFaJQJqCwTq6huHbNQ) since 2013 and data from catalogs built with [CFHT data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/kazCveSzRg6JWsyW469QiA) since 2015. The [contributions from the CFHT Legacy Survey to archival and catalog research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/qNA7baMyTf2qbhZ5cYDlgg) are significant. Covering a wide array of topics, CFHT's contributions span from the [discovery of Gravitational Arcs](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1987A%26A...172L..14S) and the characterization of [Dark Energy](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2006/07/aa4185-05.pdf) to studies of the light curve of [`Oumuamua`](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25020) and the discovery and follow-up of Near-Earth Objects and [Potential Hazardous Asteroids](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/media/newsletters/MPC_Newsletter_Dec2023.pdf), highlighting its significant impact on numerous scientific fields.

### ESO (European Southern Observatory Telescopes)
`bibgroup:ESO/Telescopes`  This group contains refereed articles using data from ESO (European Southern Observatory) telescopes. Papers since publication year 1996 using data from Paranal (VLT, VLTI, VISTA, VST) or Chajnantor facilities (ESO observing time of APEX or ALMA) as well as La Silla papers since publication year 2000 reference the program IDs from which the data originated. They are linked to the corresponding raw data or data products located in the ESO Science Archive. The database is maintained by the ESO Library and can be queried in more detail at [https://telbib.eso.org](https://telbib.eso.org). It is updated daily. For further questions, please contact the ESO librarians at <library@eso.org>.

### HST (Hubble Space Telescope)
`bibgroup:HST`  This group primarily contains refereed articles that made scientific use of data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) since 1991, which can be obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Papers are added continuously and may lag up to one year from date of publication. Articles are linked to the program IDs and observational data on which they are based whenever feasible. Note that matching HST proposal IDs to published papers is an ongoing project and never completely up to date. Some non-refereed articles and conference proceedings may also be included when use of the telescope's data is noted. Key papers (refereed and non-refereed) which address instrumentation or engineering systems are also included. For further information, visit the [STScI Library and Institutional Archive](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/stsci-library-and-institutional-archive/missions-publications) or contact metrics@stsci.edu.

### International Gemini Observatory
`bibgroup:Gemini`  This group contains refereed articles based on observations (including observatory archive) made at the International Gemini Observatory, NSF NOIRLab. The coverage is from 2000 to present and the group is updated monthly.

### JWST (James Webb Space Telescope)
`bibgroup:JWST`  This group primarily contains refereed articles that made scientific use of data from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) since 2022, which can be obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Papers are added continuously and may lag up to one year from date of publication. Articles are linked to the program IDs and observational data on which they are based whenever feasible. Note that matching JWST proposal IDs to published papers is an ongoing project and never completely up to date. Some non-refereed articles and conference proceedings may also be included when use of the telescope's data is noted. Key papers (refereed and non-refereed) which address instrumentation or engineering systems are included; these non-data papers may precede 2022. For further information, visit the [STScI Library and Institutional Archive](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/stsci-library-and-institutional-archive/missions-publications) or contact metrics@stsci.edu.

### Chandra Science Papers
`bibgroup:Chandra`  This group contains articles where Chandra data contributes significantly to the science in the article, also known as Chandra Science Papers. Those articles that present specific Chandra observations are linked to the data in the [Chandra Data Archive](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cda) on which they are based. The database is maintained by the Chandra Data Archive and can be queried in more detail with their [search tool](https://cxc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/cda/bibliography). For publication statistics, please visit the [Chandra Bibliography Statistics page](https://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/bibstats/bibstats.html). 

### Chandra Source Catalog
`bibgroup:Chandra/CSC`  This group contains both refereed and non-refereed articles published from 2009-present that are related to the Chandra Source Catalog, is updated monthly, and includes papers that perform scientific analysis on data from the Chandra Source Catalog. The database is maintained by the [Chandra Data Archive](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cda), but CSC metadata is not currently accessible using their search tool.

### Chandra Technical Papers
`bibgroup:Chandra/Technical`  This group contains articles pertaining to the Chandra mission and includes articles about Chandra instruments, software, and operations. The [Chandra Data Archive](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cda) maintains a [repository](https://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/cxo_papers/cxo_papers.html) of these papers grouped by individual instrument, operations, and software.

### NOIRLab (National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory)
