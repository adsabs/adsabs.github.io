### What are Bibgroups? 
Bibgroups are libraries that are curated by librarians, archivists and scientists who are not ADS/SciX employees. Descriptions of each bibgroup include information that details the coverage in the collection and frequency of updates.  Many of the bibgroups include contact information for the maintainer. We maintain links to [ADS legacy bibgroups](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/legacy/#ads-legacy-bibgroups) that are no longer updated but contain useful information.

### CFHT
`bibgroup:CFHT`  This bibliographic group includes peer reviewed papers by researchers worldwide using data from the [Canada-France-Hawaiʻi Telescope (CFHT)](https://www.cfht.hawaii.edu). CFHT is located on Maunakea, land of the Kānaka Maoli people, and a mountain of considerable cultural, natural and ecological significance to the Indigenous Hawaiian people. It comprises all papers utilizing every instrument ever used at CFHT, dating back to 1979 when the first CFHT paper was published. The CFHT community consists primarily of scientists from Canada, France and the University of Hawaiʻi, and from institutions in Taiwan, China, Brazil and Korea, though research teams often include members outside this community. The list also features papers using [archival data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/Ck5RwFaJQJqCwTq6huHbNQ) since 2013 and data from catalogs built with [CFHT data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/kazCveSzRg6JWsyW469QiA) since 2015. The [contributions from the CFHT Legacy Survey to archival and catalog research](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/qNA7baMyTf2qbhZ5cYDlgg) are significant. Covering a wide array of topics, CFHT's contributions span from the [discovery of Gravitational Arcs](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1987A%26A...172L..14S) and the characterization of [Dark Energy](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2006/07/aa4185-05.pdf) to studies of the light curve of [`Oumuamua](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25020) and the discovery and follow-up of Near-Earth Objects and [Potential Hazardous Asteroids](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/media/newsletters/MPC_Newsletter_Dec2023.pdf), highlighting its significant impact on numerous scientific fields.

<a name="eso-telescopes"></a>
### ESO/Telescopes
`bibgroup:ESO/Telescopes`  This group contains refereed articles using data from ESO (European Southern Observatory) telescopes. Papers since publication year 1996 using data from Paranal (VLT, VLTI, VISTA, VST) or Chajnantor facilities (ESO observing time of APEX or ALMA) as well as La Silla papers since publication year 2000 reference the program IDs from which the data originated. They are linked to the corresponding raw data or data products located in the ESO Science Archive. The database is maintained by the ESO Library and can be queried in more detail at [https://telbib.eso.org](https://telbib.eso.org). It is updated daily. For further questions, please contact the ESO librarians at <library@eso.org>.

<a name="hst"></a>
### HST
`bibgroup:HST`  This group primarily contains refereed articles that made scientific use of data from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) since 1991, which can be obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Papers are added continuously and may lag up to one year from date of publication. Articles are linked to the program IDs and observational data on which they are based whenever feasible. Note that matching HST proposal IDs to published papers is an ongoing project and never completely up to date. Some non-refereed articles and conference proceedings may also be included when use of the telescope’s data is noted. Key papers (refereed and non-refereed) which address instrumentation or engineering systems are also included. For further information, visit the [STScI Library and Institutional Archive](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/stsci-library-and-institutional-archive/missions-publications) or contact metrics@stsci.edu.

<a name="gemini"></a>
### Gemini
`bibgroup:Gemini`  This group contains refereed articles based on observations (including observatory archive) made at the International Gemini Observatory, NSF NOIRLab. The coverage is from 2000 to present and the group is updated monthly. The Gemini Publications by Users webpage contains more information such as instruments and observation program IDs used for the publication.

<a name="jwst"></a>
### JWST
`bibgroup:JWST`  This group primarily contains refereed articles that made scientific use of data from the NASA/ESA/CSA James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) since 2022, which can be obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) at Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI). Papers are added continuously and may lag up to one year from date of publication. Articles are linked to the program IDs and observational data on which they are based whenever feasible. Note that matching JWST proposal IDs to published papers is an ongoing project and never completely up to date. Some non-refereed articles and conference proceedings may also be included when use of the telescope’s data is noted. Key papers (refereed and non-refereed) which address instrumentation or engineering systems are included; these non-data papers may precede 2022. For further information, visit the [STScI Library and Institutional Archive](https://www.stsci.edu/scientific-community/stsci-library-and-institutional-archive/missions-publications) or contact metrics@stsci.edu.

<a name="chandra"></a>
### Chandra
`bibgroup:Chandra`  This group contains articles where Chandra data contributes significantly to the science in the article, also known as Chandra Science Papers. Those articles that present specific Chandra observations are linked to the data in the [Chandra Data Archive](https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/cda) on which they are based. The database is maintained by the Chandra Data Archive and can be queried in more detail with their [search tool](https://cxc.harvard.edu/cgi-gen/cda/bibliography). For publication statistics, please visit the [Chandra Bibliography Statistics page](https://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/bibstats/bibstats.html).

### NOIRLab
`bibgroup:NOIRLab`  The NOIRLab bibgroup is a curated list of the U.S. National Science Foundation National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (NSF NOIRLab / NOIRLab). The bibgroup comprises refereed science data publications in a core set of journals that use NOIRLab telescope data and/or NOIRLab data products & services. The bibgroup includes publications relating to the International Gemini Observatory from 2000 to present and publications relating to NOIRLab data products & services and the other NOIRLab telescopes from 1990 to present. Telescopes included are the NOIRLab Mid-Scale Observatories (MSO) telescopes: Nicholas U. Mayall 4-meter Telescope; WIYN 3.5-meter Telescope; and WIYN 0.9-meter Telescope, located at Kitt Peak National Observatory, Tucson, Arizona, USA; the Víctor M. Blanco 4-meter Telescope and SMARTS Consortium telescopes, located at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, La Serena, Chile; and the SOAR telescope, located at Cerro Pachón, Chile; and the International Gemini Observatory Gemini North and Gemini South telescopes. The bibgroup also includes publications that make use of NOIRLab-granted community-access time on non-NOIRLab telescopes. NOIRLab data products and provided by the NOIRLab Community Science and Data Center include the Astro Data Archive, Astro Data Lab, NOIRLab Source Catalog, ANTARES, and NOIRLab IRAF. The bibgroup is updated weekly.

### SETI
`bibgroup:SETI`  The SETI bibgroup is a topical bibliographic group, part of a project at the Penn State Extraterrestrial Intelligence Center to find and track the SETI literature. This includes all kinds of technosignature search, theoretical explorations of the nature of technological alien life, and social aspects of SETI such as METI and post-detection protocols.  The bibgroup is continuously maintained, and one can subscribe to receive a selection of monthly updates to it as new papers are published at seti.news.  The methodology is described in Reyes & Wright (2019) and LaFond et al. (2021). The intention is that the bibgroup be comprehensive including every ADS/SciX entry relevant to SETI. Questions, comments, or notices of omissions can be directed to <astrowright@gmail.com>.
