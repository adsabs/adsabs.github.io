### What are Bibgroups? 
Bibgroups are libraries that are curated by librarians, archivists and scientists who are not ADS/SciX employees. Descriptions of each bibgroup include information that details the coverage in the collection and frequency of updates.  Many of the bibgroups include contact information for the maintainer. We maintain links to [ADS legacy bibgroups](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/legacy/#ads-legacy-bibgroups) that are no longer updated but contain useful information.
