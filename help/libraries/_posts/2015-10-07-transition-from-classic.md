With the early release of the private libraries in ADS Bumblebee, we currently do not have a simple method to port your old libraries from ADS Classic or 2.0. However, we know this feature is heavily wanted, and it is on the ADS road map. 

Keep an eye on the [ADS news](https://adsabs.github.io/blog/news) or these [help pages](https://adsabs.github.io/help) for when this feature will be available.
