There are two ways to create a private library:

  1. Do a [search on ADS bumblebee](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#search/q=star), select your relevant papers, and select the **Add papers to library** button. Fill in a library name and press submit.
  2. Go the **My Account** drop down and select **ADS Libraries**. Press the **Create a library** button.

Currently, it is possible to modify the name and description of the library you have created. To do this, simply navigate to the ADS Libraries page from the **My Account** drop down, at the top right of the web interface. Once there, you can select your library of interest, and press **edit** on the attribute you would like to modify.

To delete any of the bibcodes in your library, simply navigate to the library and press the red **x** next to the bibcode you do not want in the library.
