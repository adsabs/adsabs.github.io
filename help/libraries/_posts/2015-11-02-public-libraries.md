You can make your library publicly viewable to non-ADS users by going to the **Manage Access** tab within your ADS Libraries section under **My Account**. Press the **Make this library public** button to make it public. This button generates a unique URL that you can give to people to view your library. You have the option to make your library private again in the future, in the same part of the interface. By default, all libraries are private.

More detailed permissions and sharing will be available in the near future, and will be made available under the **Manage Access** panel.
