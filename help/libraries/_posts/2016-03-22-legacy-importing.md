#### Linking accounts

If you have an account in our legacy system, ADS Classic, it is possible to import libraries from your old account into the new ADS interface. 

First login with your normal credentials on the new ADS, and then navigate to the *Customize Settings* page:

Once there, select **Import Libraries** in the left panel:

If you are linking an ADS Classic account, you will need to specify your email, your password used for your ADS Classic account, and the mirror at which you have an account.

If you need to link a different account, then simply press **Sign into a new Classic account**

#### Importing libraries

Once you have successfully connected your ADS Classic account with the new ADS, you now have the option to import your ADS Classic libraries into the new ADS.

You can see my original ADS Classic library now exists in the new ADS:

**ADS Classic**

**The new ADS**

<u><b>ATTENTION</b>: the following rules are used to import your libraries into the new interface</u>

  1. **All the libraries you own** will be imported, and created with their 'Name' and 'Description' from ADS Classic. Entries for all bibcodes for each library will be created also. However, notes attached to individual entries within a library will not be imported and are not supported in the new ADS.
  2. If you have a library in the new ADS with the same name, it will **merge** the documents from your ADS Classic library into the new ADS; **the new ADS takes precedent**.
  3. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish, but must keep in mind the actions of 2. and 3.
  4. You **cannot undo** your import, you must delete a library and re-import if you make a mistake.

## FAQ

 * "*I can't seem to authenticate my ADS Classic account*"

   Make sure you i) actually have an ADS Classic account, and ii) that you selected the correct mirror - otherwise it won't work. If you are still running into trouble, then <a href="mailto:adshelp@cfa.harvard.edu">contact us</a>.

 * "*I can't seem to import my libraries*"

   You should make sure you actually have any libraries to import from your ADS Classic library. It is more than likely you are trying to import from an account that does not have any. However, if you do have libraries and keep running into this problem then <a href="mailto:adshelp@cfa.harvard.edu">contact us</a>.

 * "*I can't find the export format for the software I'm trying to use*"

   If you think we should supply a format for another third-party software that is used then <a href="mailto:adshelp@cfa.harvard.edu">let us know</a>.
