Previously, ADS had mirror sites hosted at servers across the world that were listed at [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/mirrors.html](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/mirrors.html). However, these mirror sites have been defunct since mid-2018 when we upgraded our infrastructure from being hosted at local servers to cloud based. This move to the cloud was made to improve the speed and reliability of ADS as our content base was growing. For more information, please see this blog post outlining the differences between the [Classic ADS and the New ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/blog/technical).
