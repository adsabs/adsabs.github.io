**This is an extensive list of methods of querying the ADS system.**
It is a technical document and you probably don't need to read it unless you are interested in performing advanced searches.

**Solr (Virtual) Fields, Operators, and Other Stuff**

An aggregated list of the fields, operators, and other parameters that are accessible from Solr. Descriptions of what they are used for, and why or where they should or should not be shown to users.

| pos() | n | y | - | The pos() operator allows you to search for an item within a field by specifying the position in the field. The syntax for this operator is pos(fieldedquery,position,[endposition]). If no endposition is given, then it is assumed to be endposition = position, otherwise this performs a query within the range [position, endposition]. |
