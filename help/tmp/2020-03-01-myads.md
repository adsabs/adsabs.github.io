# myADS Notifications (for beta testing)

The myADS notification service delivers daily or weekly email updates based on your designated keywords or searches.

[FAQs](#faqs)

## Setup
There are 5 types of notifications you can create: arXiv, citations, authors, keywords, and general. The first 4 are roughly equivalent to their counterparts in Classic, as described below. The fifth, the general notification type, is new and is designed to allow for more flexibility in creating and generating notifications.

To create a new notification (for all notifications except for the general notifications), go to the [myADS settings page](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/myads) and click the Create button. Choose your notification type from the menu on the next screen, then follow directions for your chosen notification type as given below.

### arXiv
The arXiv notifications are designed as a replacement to the daily arXiv emails generated by Classic. They are generated daily on weekdays and notify you of all new arXiv papers in a selected set of arXiv categories or sub-categories. Optionally, you can also specify keywords to be notified of any new arXiv papers in your designated arXiv categories that match those keywords. During setup, you'll be asked to select your arXiv categories and specify any keywords, as desired.

Things to note during setup:
* You can choose to receive notifications for either a top-level category, such as astro-ph, or for individual sub-categories, such as astro-ph.CO
* To search for keywords in specific fields, use search tags such as *title:*. If no search tags are specified, given keywords will be searched for in all paper metadata
* If multiple keywords are given, by default the search assumes all keywords are necessary for a match. This can be overridden by explicitly combining multiple keywords with OR. Other operators, such as AND, NOT, plus (+), and minus (-) are also allowed, similar to regular searching
* All papers from the designated arXiv categories that day are shown in the email notification, so if many categories are selected, the daily email can grow quite large

### Citations
The citations notifications are designed as a replacement to the weekly citations notifications generated by Classic. They are generated weekly over the weekend and notify you of up to 5 papers that cite work by you or another specified author. Only new citations are shown.

<figure>
   <img src="/img/myads_citations.png"  class="img-responsive">
</figure>

Things to note during setup:
* During setup, you can provide multiple name variations and/or your ORCID ID to identify your papers. Notifications include any papers added since the last update citing work by any of the given author name(s) or ORCID IDs
* Weekly emails are no longer split into astronomy, physics, and arXiv collections notifications, but are instead condensed into a single email that queries all collections. If your papers cannot be uniquely specified via your name or name variations, consider setting up an ORCID ID and claiming the papers you wish to receive citations notifications for. Alternatively, you can set up a general notification that includes the desired collection. The syntax for this would be, for example, *citations(author:"Huchra, J.") collection:astronomy*.

### Authors
The authors notifications are generated weekly over the weekend and notify you of up to 5 new papers by any of the given authors. Only papers added since the last update will be shown. The setup interface is similar to that of the citations notifications and either author names or ORCID IDs can be provided. Again, as for the citations notifications, the astronomy, physics, and weekly arXiv emails are now combined. Use name variations or ORCID IDs to disambiguate, or set up a general notification that includes the desired collection.

### Keywords
The keywords notifications are generated weekly over the weekend and notify you of newly added papers about a given set of keywords or other query. Three queries are constructed for the given search term(s): recent papers, trending papers, and useful papers. Recent papers shows the 5 most recent papers matching the given query, while trending papers shows the 5 papers that best match the query *[trending](../search/second-order)(query)*. Useful papers shows the 5 papers that best match the query *[useful](../search/second-order)(query)*.

Things to note during setup:
* Search tags, such as *title:* can be used with query terms, as in a regular search. If no search tags are given, all metadata is searched for a given search term, as in a regular search
* As in a regular search, if multiple search terms are provided and Boolean operators are not given, a Boolean AND is assumed. This means that all search terms must be found for a given paper to be included in the search results. If a match on any provided search term is desired, separate individual search terms with *OR*. Other operators allowed in regular searching, such as NOT, plus (+), and minus (-) are also allowed

### General
The general notifications are new and did not have an equivalent in the Classic notification system. To set one up, execute a search that you'd like to receive notifications for, including any desired filters from the left sidebar. On the search results page, click on the bar labeled **Create Email Notification** in the right sidebar.

Enter a query name, which will be displayed in the main listing of myADS notifications and in the myADS emails, and choose a daily or weekly notifications schedule. Note that currently only new arXiv listings are added daily, while other new articles are added on a weekly basis. For most queries, you'll be notified of the latest papers matching the query. However, for queries that include an operator, such as *trending()*, you'll be notified of papers that best match the query terms.

## Editing
If you've created or imported notifications, you can edit them from the [myADS settings page](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/myads). Top-level settings can be changed directly from this page, using the Actions menu associated with each notification. Available actions include:
* Disable/Enable: select to disable or enable email notifications. If disabled, the setup will remain in your settings but email notifications will not be sent. Disabled notifications appear greyed out in the main notification listing
* Run Query: select to run the query and display the results in the search results page. For time-sensitive queries, such as daily arXiv notifications, the query will be run as it would if notifications were generated today
* Edit: select to view the detail-level settings for a given notification
* Delete: select to delete a notification from your list. Note that this action cannot be reversed

Detail-level settings, accessed via the Edit button as described above, are displayed on a screen similar to the initial setup screen for each notification type. The initial setup, including keywords or author names, can be edited here. In addition, for all notification types except the general notification type, query names are generated automatically upon creation. The name, which appears on the myADS settings page and on the generated email notifications, can be edited after creation here on the detail-level settings page for all notification types.

## Importing
There are two methods to import your Classic notifications settings into the new system: automatic and manual.

### Automatic importing
When we first enable the new myADS system, we'll run a script that will attempt to match user accounts in the new ADS with those from Classic. If your Classic and new ADS accounts were registered under the same email address, or if you've previously signed into your Classic account in the new ADS in order to import your libraries, we'll likely be able to automatically import your myADS settings. If we were able to automatically import your settings, they'll appear on the [myADS setup screen](https://dev.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/myads).

### Manual importing
If your Classic myADS notification settings were not imported automatically from Classic, you can use the myADS import tool to import these. From the [myADS setup screen](https://dev.adsabs.harvard.edu/user/settings/myads), click the Import button.

Enter your Classic username and password along with the mirror your account was registered on and click Login to complete your sign-in.

After logging into your Classic account in the new ADS successfully, you can click Begin Import.

A message will be displayed after import with the number of successfully imported settings. If the import has been run previously, only notifications that do not exist in your account in the new ADS will be imported. The displayed message will indicate the number of new vs. existing notifications that were found in your Classic account.

## FAQs
### My imported keywords (or other imported setup) are formatted differently in the new ADS than they were in Classic.
The import tool attempts to correct formatting issues that will cause queries to fail in the new ADS, including removing new line characters, extra parentheses, and other non-standard special characters. Also, in Classic, keywords that were not explicitly combined with Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) were assumed to be combined with OR, while in the new ADS the implied operator is AND. The import tool converts between these as necessary. If you think your query was not translated correctly during testing, please let us know both the original Classic query and the translated query output by the import tool. You can then edit the imported query as necessary to match your original logic.

### There's no place for me to specify which databases/collections I want my weekly emails processed from.
In Classic, myADS weekly emails were generated separately for astronomy, physics, and arXiv papers. However, in the new ADS, weekly myADS notifications are consolidated into a single email. If your search terms are generating too many results without this separation by collection, try narrowing your search terms (see guidance for each notification type, above) or using a general notification with a collection specified.

### I've imported my settings from Classic but am not receiving emails.
The import tool checks to see whether you had email notifications enabled. If you weren't receiving emails in Classic, they've also been disabled here. To enable emails again, see the Editing section above.
