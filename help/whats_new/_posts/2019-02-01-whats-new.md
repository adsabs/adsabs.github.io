   + **Final Blog Post in SciX Data Linking and Indexing Series by Edwin Henneken**<br>
     The final installment in Edwin Henneken's three-part [blog series](../../blog) for SciX is now available. This concluding post offers an insightful exploration into the advanced processes of data linking and indexing within the Science Explorer. We invite you to check out the entire 3-part series below.<br>
     **[Part I: Data Holdings](../../blog/data-linking-I)**<br>
     This post explains how SciX integrates literature with research data, software, and services. It describes how data is represented within SciX, using a graph of digital objects and their relationships to illustrate the system's structure. This sets the foundation for understanding the data linking mechanisms that support the FAIR principles in physical sciences.<br>
     **[Part II: Linked Data](../../blog/data-linking-II)**<br>
     The second post discusses linked data within the Research Life Cycle framework. It highlights the importance of linking digital artifacts like data and software to scholarly articles. The post also covers the process of capturing and indexing citations to these research products and provides strategies for finding linked data within SciX.<br>
     **[Part III: Cited Data](../../blog/data-linking-III)**<br>
     This final part explains how SciX manages cited data products. There is no fundamental difference between articles citing other articles, and articles citing data. Citations are just one small subset of the entire graph of linkages between research assets.

   + **Video Spotlight**<br>
     On 17 July, Dr. Alberto Accomazzi, Principal Investigator of the Astrophysics Data System and the Science Explorer, presented a lecture at the Johns Hopkins Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP). His talk, "The NASA Astrophysics Data System: A Case Study in the Integration of AI and Digital Libraries," explored the evolution and future of the ADS, focusing on the integration of AI techniques. The lecture is now available for [viewing here on the CLSP YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/live/WOPmjFag0Dc?si=wfj-faW8uXo_w5Uh).

   + **New Blog: Historic Observatory Publications in the Science Explorer** - Discover the rich legacy of historic scientific publications now available through the Science Explorer (SciX). Foundational archives, including work from renowned observatories, have been meticulously digitized and are accessible to all. [Dive into our full blog post here](../../blog/HistoricLit) to learn more about these invaluable records and how you might also contribute to preserving the history of science.

   + **Upcoming Conferences & Events Featuring SciX & ADS** - In June, the SciX team is looking forward to connecting with our user community at the [American Astronomical Society (AAS) 244th Meeting](https://aas.org/meetings/aas244) (9-13 June, Madison, WI) and the [American Libraries Association 2024 Annual Conference](https://2024.alaannual.org/registration/rates-and-registration) (27 June-2 July, San Diego, CA) where our staff will be based at the NASA Booth #1939. If you are attending the #AAS224 Meeting, don’t forget to visit us at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Data System Booth in the exhibit hall or to join us for the following poster presentations and special session: 
      - **Historic Observatory Publications in the Astrophysics Data System**
        <br>**Authors**: Jennifer Bartlett, Donna Thompson, the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) Team
        <br>**iPoster Session**: 107.02 History iPoster, Terminal #27
        <br>**Date & Time**: Monday, 10 June from 9-10am CT
        <br>**Location**: Monona Terrace Convention Center Exhibit Hall A<br>
        
        This iPoster highlights the efforts of Science Explorer (SciX) in digitizing and preserving historic observatory publications. It emphasizes the importance of these documents, which contain foundational astronomical research and unique observational data, and outlines the process and criteria for including new materials in the archive. The poster also discusses the expansion of ADS to include planetary science, heliophysics, and earth science, while maintaining its commitment to the astronomy and astrophysics communities.
      - **Historic Observatories: Don’t Forget the Data!**
        <br>**Authors**: James Lattis, University of Wisconsin, Madison; R. Elizabeth Griffin, Herzberg Astronomy & Astrophysics Research Centre; Wayne Osborn, Central Michigan University; Jennifer Bartlett, NASA/SAO ADS (SciX)

We will now update the searchable metadata and pages within ADS to reflect an author's current name, as need requires, even if that differs from the publisher's metadata for those papers.
    + Our user-facing API is now fully documented using the OpenAPI specification! [Explore the API](../../help/api/api-docs.html) and make test API calls, all from the convenience of your browser.
    + Now available: dark mode! You can toggle the setting manually or let your system’s setting turn it on for you.

      + **[improved]** Help pages: restructured [main API help page](../../help/api/); added [journal macros](../../help/actions/journal-macros) and macros .sty pages (moved from Classic)
