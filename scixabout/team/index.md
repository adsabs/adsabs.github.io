The late [Stephen S. Murray](https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/news/stephen-s-murray-high-energy-astrophysicist-dies-age-70) served as the Principal Investigator of the NASA Astrophysics Data Service (ADS) from its inception in 1993 until his passing in August 2015. SciX is the expansion of that digital library to heliophysics, earth science, and planetary science that began in 2021.
