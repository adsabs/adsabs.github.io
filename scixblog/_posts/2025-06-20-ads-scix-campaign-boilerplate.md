## Objective

A long-form and short-form boilerplate to clarify messaging around the future of ADS and SciX, to be used to inform members of the research community and empower them to advocate for future funding for the platform.

## Uses

- Advocacy
- Social media
- Conference talks
- Informal discussions

## Long Form

It is with a heavy heart that we confirm that the team and infrastructure behind the Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and Science Explorer (SciX) will be subjected to significant funding cuts, as the latest victim of the widely reported budget restrictions being placed upon NASA.

[ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu) has served the astrophysics research community for well over three decades, helping its users discover research, find collaborators, and understand the impact of their work. In recent years, ADS has provided the framework for a new evolution of research discovery platform, [Science Explorer, or SciX](https://scixplorer.org), which includes research relevant to the entire NASA Science Mission Directorate. In its development, the Beta version of SciX has been elevating the discovery potential of research in Heliophysics and all aspects of Earth, environmental, and planetary sciences, and is already more complete than the Web of Science in these disciplines. Like ADS, SciX is completely open and provides access to full text literature search, including funded projects, data and software products. 

Both ADS and SciX continue to significantly support NASA's Open Science mission. However, like many other programs impacted by recent budget cuts, NASA recently confirmed that after this financial year, there will be no further funding available to develop the SciX platform, and there will be significant reduction in ADS's funding. In real terms, a funding hit of this scale may result in the sunsetting of both platforms. However, we hope to find a way to rescue these vital aspects of research infrastructure.

The team behind both projects is working hard to find a way to save these platforms, and continue to ensure that this research makes the greatest possible impact on society and the maximum possible return on research investment. Ultimately we are looking for new and sustainable funding streams with values that align with those that ADS and SciX were built upon, and that is to democratize access to research and improve the everyday efficiency of researchers.

We understand that this news will come as a shock to our user communities. We hope that with your continued support we will find a way to secure a bright and sustainable future for ADS and its even more powerful successor, SciX.

Once we have a clearer path ahead of us, we will share more information. Please join the [ADS/SciX mailing list](https://harvard.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=ed0cf26186d0cdd7bad11ed29&id=2c6299b24b) to be the first to hear of any good news. And until then, please continue to use the platforms in your work, and let us know of any ADS/SciX related research success stories. Our platforms are built by scientists, for scientists. In spite of the current budgetary challenges, we believe in the value and the future of open science. We will try our hardest to continue supporting you with authoritative and reliable information, as we have been doing for 30 years and counting. Thank you for continuing to be part of our community.

## Short Version

Unfortunately ADS and SciX are the latest victims of the budget restrictions being placed on NASA. The significant 60% obliteration of funding in the next financial year threatens the existence of both platforms. The ADS/SciX team is working hard to find alternative sources of funding to secure the future of platforms, and hope that the community will help support a case to potential future platform partners by sharing the impact that ADS and SciX have had on their research careers.
