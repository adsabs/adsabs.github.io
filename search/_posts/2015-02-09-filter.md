Once you have a results list from an initial query you can use our filters to further refine your search.  Please note that your results list will change each time you apply a limit.  Each limit appears above the top of the results list and can be undone simply by clicking on the *x* in each box (or clearing all filters but chosing "Clear all."  Currently we have the following options available:

Clicking on a **>** will detail your results for that filter.

Clicking on any of the listed terms within a filter will automatically apply that result as a filter; if you want to choose more than one term within a specific filter you must first check the boxes next to the terms you want to choose and then choose the desired application ( **and**, **or** or **exclude**) from the **apply** box in that section.
[**EXAMPLE**](examples#filtering-within-facet)

  * *Top papers*--here you can chose to limit your search to the first xxx results (where you chose the number xxx either by typing in the number or using the scroll bar.)  Hitting apply activates this option.  You may return to the original results by using the reset button.
  * *Authors*--here you may chose to limit your search to include or exclude individual authors.  To do this choose one or more authors and the *apply* function will activate.  Here you can choose to "and", "or" or "exclude" authors from your resulting list. 
  * *Database*--here you may chose to add results from the database(s) that were not selected in your original query.  You may also chose to exclude a database that was initially chosen.  
  * *Keywords*--here you may chose to narrow your results by including or excluding keywords that were found in the results of your original query.  
  * *Publications*--here you may chose to narrow your results by including or excluding journals that were found in the results of your original query. 
  * *Refereed status*--here you may chose to include or exclude refereed or non-refereed publications
  * *Bib Groups*--here you may chose to include or exclude results from different Bib Groups within the ADS
  * *Grants*--here you may chose to include or exclude results that reference grant numbers that were recognized in the original search
  * *Data*--here you may chose to include or exclude results that contain data in various archives (e.g. CDS, HEASARC, CXO, NED)
  * *Vizier Tables*--here you may chose to include or exclude articles that have Vizier Tables
  * *Publication Year*--here you may chose to limit your results to a specified time period by typing in the year range or using the provided slide bar
